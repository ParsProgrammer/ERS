662,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B004TPUT9Y,"Pasta that is gluten free and made in the microwave sounds awful, but the rice pasta in the Pastariso Mac and Cheese meal cup turned out surprisingly well. I would even place it over the vegan microwave cups I've had. The texture is great and it tastes a lot like wheat pasta.Preparation is simple: add water, stir, and microwave. I have a low power microwave, so I doubled the time and it came out perfectly.The cheese sauce is very bland, without a distinct cheesy flavor. I added some sea salt and it seemed to work magic, making it much brighter and cheesier. More therapy may be needed to make this a meal, such as a can of tuna. Also, keep in mind that the portion is small.Because I really liked the pasta, I would recommend trying these (before buying a pack of 6) if you have to avoid gluten. Otherwise, there are probably better products with more flavor.Note: I've eaten the brown and white rice bowls and did not notice much difference.  The texture is good for both.  I would probably go with the brown rice version for health reasons.",3.0
275,A2YW1MG1GKU8XD,B0025UCI0I,"I have some members of my family who are not crazy about whole wheat pasta no matter how much I want to convince them that it is good for them  ;)  This is my first time trying this particular kind so I was happy to try it.This pasta has 51% whole wheat durum flour, 6 grams of fiber, and 7 grams of protein per serving, that's just the pasta!  Surprisingly, my family really liked it! Even those who are not crazy about whole wheat, they were very pleased with the bite and flavor of this spaghetti.I cooked it just like the box indicates and used it just like regular spaghetti and meatballs.  Very delicious and more nutritious.  I am definitely getting more of this.",4.0
235,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B0025UCHRC,"We've always used Barilla in this house, but occasionally have purchased an off brand that was on sale.  Sometimes the sale items are on sale for a reason and we've ended up with a box that tasted just like that ... a box.  I like to transfer my pastas to glass jars when I get them.  It not only maintains the freshness, but it also looks nice.  I enjoy regular mezze penne tossed with olive oil, chunk tomatoes, and veggies, but the multigrain was a new one on me.  I do like the whole wheat Barilla pastas and decidedly enjoyed this one as well.  I simply prepared it in the same way I usually do, yet found it had a richer flavor to it. Traditional sauces for mezze penne are meat, vegetable, chunky tomato, and cream saucesThis Barilla Penne Plus will cook up in 11 - 13 minutes.  What I especially like about it is the higher protein count (10g per serving) as I'm always looking for foods that are nutritionally balanced as well as high in protein.  In addition there are 360 mg of ALA Omega-3 and 7g of fiber, something else I really like.  Barilla products are one of our family's ""stock up"" items and we tend to buy it in bulk and this is one I'll be adding to the list.  Barilla Mezze Penne Plus is especially good for one of those quick and easy meals, especially if you need something hot, yet healthy.NUTRITION FACTS:Serving Size:  2 oz.(56g - about 1/7 box)Servings Per Container about 7Calories  210Calories from Fat  20Total Fat 2gSaturated Fat  0gTrans Fat  0gPolyunsaturated Fat  1gMonounsaturated Fat  0.5gCholesterol  0mgSodium  025gTotal Carbohydrate  38gDietary Fiber  4gSugars  2gProtein 10gINGREDIENTS:Semolina, Grain and Legume Flour Blend [Grains and Legumes (Lentils, Chickpeas, Flaxseed, Barley, Spelt, Oats), Egg Whites, Oat Fiber], Durum Flour, Niacin, Iron (Ferrous Sulfate), Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid.Barilla Mezze PenneBarilla Mini WheelsBarilla Linguine FiniBarilla Mini FarfalleBarilla SpaghettiBarilla Oven Ready LasagneBarilla White Fiber - Mini PenneBarilla Spaghetti RigatiBarilla Ditalini Soup CutsBarilla Campanelle Pasta",5.0

Honestly, the strength of the tuna taste FAR outweighs any spice that is added.  I can't really say that you can taste anything BUT tuna, but it is good and a great snack.  You don't get enough crackers, however, so be sure to grab a box of Ritz to supplement them.  They are pretty bland crackers too - no flavor at all so I actually used Ritz on most of the can.Great if you love tuna, nice, not so fattening snack too.  Recommend!",4.0
1148,A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,B0096RP84Q,"The soups are flavorful and the ease of preparation is remarkable. Approximately two servings are contained in each microwavable pouch. Just tear the top of the pouch as directed, microwave for two to two and half minutes, let stand for a minute and serve. The directions are clear and the design thoughtful.So far I have tried two varieties, the Chicken and Quinoa with Poblano Chiles and the Red Pepper Smoked Gouda. The Chicken Quinoa was like a mild chicken chile.  There were chunks of shredded chicken, corn, beans and chiles. It was thicker than soup, the consistency like a stew. I was pleased that there was flavor and it made a nice warming dish on a cold winter day.The Red Pepper Smoked Gouda had a more soup-like consistency.  There were a few chunks of pepper and maybe tomato. I think they should have committed to either chunky or smooth and personally would have preferred it without the  chunks. The flavor was decent with the smokey gouda melding with the pepper.Overall these are decent entries in the conveninece foods race. The ease of preparation can't be beat and the flavors are good for a prepared soup. While I enjoyed them for lunch I could see either being a component in a more complex meal.",4.0

It has 130 mg of salt per teaspoon, which made it taste a little too salty for my family.  It tasted a little better the next day, when the flavors had mixed, but I'll stick with Hidden Valley for my holiday dips.I give this product 3.5 stars.",3.0
1330,A2YW1MG1GKU8XD,B009WPKGQC,"I have to say that being a hot sauce lover, I was skeptical of the flavor of this sauce - I think it had to do with the Hollywood bandito pic on the bottle. But I was surprised at how tasty it actually is.It contains habanero and Japanese chili peppers which are pretty hot peppers.  My husband and I like ""El Yucateco Red Chile Habanero Sauce"" which is very hot and it has habanero peppers and tomato, so I thought the gringo bandito sauce would be in the same heat category or even more.To my surprise, I found this sauce very tasty.  The heat is not overpowering and yet it has a nice flavor to it.  It has plenty of spices to make it delicious.  It has Xantham Gum which makes a nice thickening, and of course, the best ingredient must be the `mojo'.I am assuming that the kind of vinegar they use (first ingredient) is something like apple cider vinegar.  It would make sense since ACV tends to kill some heat but yet, bring a tasty flavor to sauces (I have done this in my own sauces).  We have used this sauce on different things from eggs to hot dogs.  We can't wait to try it on pizza!We will definitely be buying some here soon, we are about to use a bunch tonight with lamb tacos. Highly recommend it if you like a good hot sauce.  This is not made for people that cannot tolerate Tabasco sauce or something in that heat level.  It is not super hot, but it is not mild either.  Very tasty, very tasty.",5.0

It has a very nice light flavor and works well in basically any dish that requires oil.  I have used it for both cooking (stir fry) and flavor (rice) with good results.

1753,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B00DBSG77S,"There are two components to review: the container cup and the crackers.  Cheez-Its are a classic treat, combining basic crackers with generic cheese powder.  This doesn't sound exciting, but the generic flavor allows them to work well with many types of foods, such as soups and sandwiches.  As a standalone treat, they are pretty addictive too.  The White Cheddar variety is similar to Original, with a milder flavor.The plastic cup seemed like a great idea, allowing me to eat a few at a time and reseal the rest.  Unfortunately, once the lid and foil cover are removed, the lid no longer fits tightly.  It is not safe to have the cup tumbling around in a car, and the contents will go stale quickly.  Even a regular foil pouch with a gem clip provides a better seal.A mini version of our favorite traditional snacks in resealable hand-friendly containers is a great idea, but the execution is not there yet.",4.0

567,A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,B004FEJ968,"Recently, I triedNewtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honeycookies.  Then someone brought a package of the Cranberry type to work.  I like the cranberry cookies better.The cookies themselves are good. They are thin, but that was the idea, wasn't it? The cookies have a nice texture. You can taste the cranberries. The calorie count, 140 for three cookies, is about the same as the granola bars that I sometimes snack on. Just don't eat the whole box at once.The ingredients are also reasonable with the exception of the use of palm oil. As palm oil use has increased dramatically over the past ten years, commercial growers have been clearing rain forests in Indonesia and Malaysia to create palm oil plantations. The palm oil is used in food production, as in these cookies, and in the manufacture of bio-fuels. The result is a loss of endangered species and ironically increased carbon emission. There has been some movement to either reduce palm oil use or use only palm oil from sustainable sources. There have even been stories of girl scouts agitating to sell only palm-oil-free cookies.Kraft is aware of the palm oil situation. It is not clear that they are doing anything about it. This is from a July 15, 2009 Wall Street Journal article: ""Kraft spokesman Richard D. Buino said that while the company supports the RSPO's [Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil] efforts, 'it is clear more work is needed to consolidate standards, enforce principles, verify traceability along the supply chain and ensure competitive pricing to bring certified palm oil to market. We're monitoring the RSPO process and actively engaging our suppliers to monitor their certification efforts to find viable options for sourcing sustainable palm oil.' Neither Nestl&eacute; nor Kraft directly addressed purchases of Malaysia's certified palm oil.""",4.0

Essentially, they are a heavily covered caramel corn, drizzled over with just the right amount of chocolate.I am trying to be specific about the level of caramel, since the brand I have been using is actually ""kettle corn"" with the chocolate, and taste quite different than these do. These are much sweeter, and really hit home when it comes to having a ""sweet tooth.""Since they have 150 calories, you will need to be cautious about including them in your diet, but if you are a caramel corn fan, it will be well worth finding a place for these.",4.0

1989,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B00ID9VSOM,"I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect when I tried the Viva labs coconut sugar.  It looks quite similar to dark brown sugar, but didn&#8217;t have quite the heavy, sweet taste I was expecting.  Because I&#8217;m so accustomed to the extremely sweet taste from artificial sweeteners, the taste was much different.The best way for me to experience the actual taste, was not in a recipe, but rather by putting it on my oatmeal.  It has a light touch of natural sweetness that livened up the taste of my oatmeal, but didn&#8217;t overwhelm it.  It doesn&#8217;t taste like coconut nor like the Viva Labs coconut oil, something I really love when I fry vegetables.Table sugar is well-known for its empty calories, but from what reading I&#8217;ve done, the coconut sugar does have some nutritional value.  For those who are keeping a close watch on calories, the Viva Labs coconut sugar does have 16 calories per tablespoon.If I&#8217;m going to use sugar of any kind, including in my baking, I use organic.  This coconut sugar has a nice light taste and much more going for it than the &#8220;regular&#8221; kind, including the fact that it&#8217;s a low-glycemic sweetener.  I&#8217;d probably opt for this sugar over the white sugar, especially if I had to deal with diabetes.Sample provided for review.",5.0
1360,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00A4ASPWG,"Knorr Rice Sides Creamy Chipotle flavor is actually rice and pasta with a cheesy sauce with a pronounced flavor of smoked peppers.  The flavor is good but not at all spicy and it needs some hot sauce to give  it a bit more kick.  Otherwise, it's a nice starchy dish.I think hikers will like it because it's cheesy enough that it can be made without the milk and butter, substituting olive oil and water or even just water and still have it taste good and have a nice texture.  Directions call for it to simmer for seven minutes after being brought to a boil and then left to mature for a couple of minutes and the rice and pasta definitely need some time to soak up the moisture and soften up.",4.0
1651,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00CTJ4JHA,"I was pleased with this bar. It tasted great - the chocolate came through very well without the usual heavy artificial taste that chocolate covered bars often have. The peanut butter was clearly there but not overpowering.The bar is soft and chewy, which is what I prefer, but it had some crunch to it due to (I assume) toasted rice. The overall result was very appealing and not messy to eat on the run (provided you peel back the wrapper so you don't get chocolate on your fingers).It is rather sweet - almost candy-bar sweet. If the sweetness was dialed down a bit this would be a five-star product. As it is it remains a decent protein bar that I would certainly get again.",4.0

1476,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,B00B2JRNBM,"This was the first Barilla Microwavable Bowl that I've ever had and I really enjoyed it.  I thought the design of the bowl was really neat.  The pasta and the sauce actually cook separately and then the sauce bowl lifts out and you just dump it on the pasta and stir.Although Barilla is my favorite brand of pasta, I've never actually had Gemelli pasta before.

777,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,B005HGJ3ZK,"I've now had both the Brown Rice and the normal White Rice cups.  My reviews are pretty much the same for both but I will say that I had a slight preference to the Brown Rice.When you're dieting and trying to lose weight, it's very convenient to have these types of little containers of food around that are between two and three hundred calories for quick and easy lunches. I was pretty excited to try this product and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't great either.Preparation- First of all they're easy to prepare but make a mess. Just remove the lid and fill with water to the ""Fill Line"". This line is hard to see but I found it and done as directed. Set the microwave on 3 1/2 minutes on high. The first time I made one of these I walked away and came back to quite a mess.  It evidently boiled over a lot while it was cooking. Having to clean the mess up once isn't bad but this is evidently a thing that'll happen every time because it happened with both of the cups that I had.  At least the 2nd time around I put a couple paper towels under the cup to try and help with cleanup.Taste- The Brown Rice wasn't that bad at all in my opinion.  As with the white rice though, I kept running into noodles that were a bit firm. Most of them were soft but there were a few that were firm and not great to eat. The texture on some of the noodles were weird as well.  Neither of these issues were as bad with the Brown Rice.  I'm not sure if it made a difference that this time I didn't eat right out of the container but actually put it in a bowl this time.Overall I didn't think this Brown Rice meal was bad but it wasn't great either. I could eat a Brown Rice cup every now and then. I would recommend trying it for yourself to see if you like it. Since it's just 212 calories it could be great for those that enjoy it.",3.0

I personally love coconut and was happy to try cooking with it. However I wondered whether or not it would be useful for very many things. I am still fairly new to coconut oil but I have been experimenting with it a lot in recent months and have found it to be my new favorite oil to cook with. I have used it to fry things in a skillet like ham. I wondered if it would taste weird but it didn't at all and I actually preferred the taste to using vegetable or canola oil. I have also used it in deserts and that is what I prefer to use it for. I have used it to make homemade fudge and it turned out really good. Yesterday I used it to make chocolate chip cookies and they were some of the most amazing cookies that I have ever had. Coconut Oil can also be used as a beauty product. If you take a little bit of it and rub it into your skin it moisturizes and makes your skin very smooth. My hands always dry out and crack as the weather turns colder out. A little bit of this coconut oil makes them feel like new again and it smells great too.This is only the second type of coconut oil that I have tried but it seems perfect quality to me.

In the past, this line was sold under the Lipton brand and then the Knorr-Lipton brand. They are quite popular with long-distance hikers as a quick, inexpensive, filling, versatile, lightweight, readily-available, one-pot meal. The same attributes make them ideal for easy preparation at home.This particular variety has a hint of south-of-the-border flavor though it would certainly benefit from more heat. It's easy to doctor these up with a little Tabasco or chili-garlic sauce, powdered chipotle, or other spices. For a complete meal, throw in whatever else you have on hand such as sausage or vegetables.The sauce in these come out a bit runny if the instructions are followed so either use slightly less water or add some green-can cheese if you have normal blood pressure and your tast buds can handle the extra saltiness.",4.0

The bacon flavor tasted very artificial (even though the package said ""real bacon!"") and there was WAY too much of a smoky taste. The smokiness overpowered everything, making it impossible to enjoy. And the parmesan must have been in hiding, since it (or any measureable taste of it) was nowhere to be found.It was also rather watery, even though I followed the directions to the letter. The pasta was cooked properly, but the sauce did not thicken up much.On the plus side the noodles were OK, and it was very easy to prepare - a single saucepan dish that takes less than 15 minutes from start to finish (including bringing the water to boil).But the taste....pretty poor.

There is not much cheese flavor, and going by macaroni and cheese prices, I don't think it would have been too costly to add.  As a whole, it tastes like bacon bits and salt sprinkled on plain pasta.

They hit the right balance.The texture is pretty crunchy, but a little less crunchy than a ""conventional"" pretzel. They do have the downside in that the texture is a little mealy, which I assume is due to the potato starch that is used rather than flour.

Gotta love this one with the three-cheeses that really liven up the dish.The olive oil went into the pan and then the mix.  A friend suggested doing this and I think it does enhance not only the texture, but also the flavor.  I added the requisite water and instead of covering and boiling, I stir fried it.

Since this was one of my main reasons for sampling this, this was the main thing I tested for in my daily routine.Taste-wise, this is good. It tastes like water and is better than the city water I get from my tap. However I do want to state that I can get similar tastes from other bottled waters on the market. This actually didn't impress me that overly much because for the most part you can get ultra-filtrated fancy water from many different sources. You need a little something extra to really stand out.That's where the electrolytes come in. To really test this I drank portions of this at the gym while I was doing my cardio, as good hydration can often make for a better workout. The water was pretty refreshing and it felt like it made a difference from the water I usually get from the water fountain by the changing rooms. It just didn't seem to make such an overwhelming difference that I'd rush out the door to buy another bottle as soon as I emptied this one.Would I buy this on my own? Under certain circumstances, yes. It's not a ""must buy"", but if I was sick and needed to rehydrate, I'd get this as an alternative to straight electrolytes.

It had too much of a chemical-y taste to it and just didn't seem to live up to all of the hype that had been going on about it. I decided to give the mix another try via Vine, so I tried this flavor. The flavor is about what I expected as well as a little better.The good about this flavor is that it's drinkable. If you're any type of Southern person then you're going to be disappointed in some regards to this flavor because it doesn't come close to matching real sweet tea, so don't even begin to have any hopes for that. However, apart from that this actually isn't that bad flavor-wise. Yes, you can instantly tell that this is a mix of chemical tastes rather than a tall glass of proper sweet tea, but for a chemical drink it isn't bad. I actually didn't mind finishing off the glass I'd made.The bad is that the mix looks completely unappetizing going into the water and that somehow I still felt thirsty after drinking this up. It looks pretty much like a bunch of chemicals mixing in with water, but most importantly the chemicals seemed to irritate my throat a little and make me feel like I was still thirsty. However, I'm more than willing to accept that maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me.Overall this isn't bad, but it isn't great either. If it's on sale I might pick this flavor up to throw in a picnic basket and as far as non-real sweet tea goes, it's not bad.

314,A1GYEGLX3P2Y7P,B0026ZYZ7Q,"I was a little nervous about trying this tea, but decided the best way to avoid a weak flavor was to not steep it in an open cup. From experience with fresh herbal tisanes, the best flavor is when the cup is covered or it steeps in a covered pot. The steam tends to release the oils, and if you cover the cup, they condensate on the lid and drip back into the cup instead of being dispersed into the air.Brewing the tea that way, and letting it steep for 5 minutes resulted in a lovely tea with great flavor. It has no bitterness, just the spicy, sweet taste of the cardamom combined with the tea. The flavors are balanced about equally.My family also likes this one very well. I knew that someone in my family would like it, because we all have pretty varied tastes. This was a hit with everyone.So, boil the water, put the tea bag and water into an 8-10 oz cup, cover cup with saucer. Let steep for 5 minutes. This is really good.

These are very different than black pepper type chips, too.  This variety isn't hugely salt filled and the coating does stay on the fingers if you eat too many or tend to lick your fingers as you eat.

1739,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00DBSG6V0,I have tried both the Keebler Fudge Grahams and the Keebler Fudge Stripe Cookies in these mini snack sized containers. The Fudge Grahams come in a 2.8 ounce size and the Fudge Stripe Cookies come in a slightly larger 3 ounce size. According to the label there are 2  servings in each container but that would make for a very small serving. I think a whole container is a good snack size to me and the same goes for my kids. The Fudge Stripe Cookies have a total of 375 calories per container or 150 calories per serving. The Fudge Grahams have a total 350 calories per container or 140 calories per serving. These little containers are easy to carry around and pack in lunches. They are sealed and they also have a plastic lid so you can easily put the lid on it and save some of them for later. Both cookies are delicious in their own way and it's hard to stop eating them. They cost a little more to purchase them in these convenient little containers but they are perfect when you are on the go or packing in lunches.,5.0

I was pretty happy with it....here are the pros/cons:I like that it packs 11 grams of fiber (44% of your daily intake), 22 grams of protein, 10% iron and 10% vitamin c. The salmon spread is pretty tasty with a little bit of spice to it, but not too much, crackers, a generous serving of dry roasted edamame, Fruit & Nut mix and an organic dark chocolate square.  I really liked the fruit/nut mix and the ginger was not overpowering.  It was a tasty mix of dried fruit, bananas and ginger peanuts....very tasty.The couple things we would like to change: you need more crackers-I think about 8 would be just about right, as you seem to have salmon spread left over unless you heap it on.  Also, a knife would be helpful to spread it, along with the fork that is included OR ditch the round crackers and use square crackers that would be easier to just dip into the spread.Overall, not a gigantic amount of food, it seemed to have proper food proportions and is perfect for one person who eats sensibly.  As it has a lot of fiber I would keep in mind that drinking enough fluids would be important with a to-go meal like this one.As far as the food, it was a nice little meal that I would keep for the office or in a backpack when I hike.I would consider buying a couple of these to have on hand and would recommend them for those that need a quick meal.",4.0

When I opened the bag, I smelled something very reminiscent of a standard cake or cookie mix... a generic vanilla flavoring.  The recipe was simple - mix a stick of butter, egg, and cookie mix is a stand mixer.  It took longer than usual, but it came together as a stiff batter.  After baking, they had held their shape nicely and looked delicious.Actually eating them was less exciting.  The vanilla flavor could be pumped up, while the sweetness could be dialed down.  More importantly, the texture was more crumbly than fluffy or chewy like a traditional sugar cookie.  On the other hand, the addition of real butter does result in a better flavor than mixes that call for oil.Are these cookies bad?  Not at all.  I enjoyed them as a gluten-free alternative.

It seems to be just the right strength in my opinion. I think its high quality green tea and I like it a lot.

I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint is from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  That, in addition to a lack of a good pronounced watermelon flavor, is why I gave this four stars.

Also, these chips are not at all a low-calorie food.

659,A3VI2VETB90ZG5,B004TPUT9Y,"The Pastar&iacute;so Mac & Cheese meal is not as flavorful as any of the other boxed macaroni and cheese products that I've tried, but for a microwave dish, especially one that is formulated to be free of gluten found in wheat, soy, eggs and nuts, it tastes alright.The water fill line can be found as a series of half-inch indentations along the inside of the cup at about three quarters the cup's height.It takes three and a half minutes on high power in the microwave, followed by a one minute period of rest before enjoying. Though not instructed to do so, I stirred the product well in between the cooking and resting times in order to make certain all of the flavor powder is thoroughly blended; this works well, as it results in a consistent, albeit thin sauce.I had to wait far longer than one minute for the sauce to thicken, yet it still came out thin. The thickness of the sauce probably depends on how much of the powdered mix boils out over the top of the cup. I had better luck with the brown rice version, which I prefer over the white rice version.This product contains twenty-eight percent of the recommended daily sodium intake, along with thirteen percent of both the daily carbohydrates and saturated fats, so this product is by no means a healthful alternative to nonrestrictive boxed macaroni recipes.

It dissolves easily too, so it works for beverages.The flavor is similar to natural toasted coconut candy, and the sweetness is less harsh than white sugar.  It can take a bit extra to overcome strong flavors like coffee, but a little bit goes a long way with green or rice tea.

1082,A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,B0091146V8,"I have alwlays savored a good cup of coffee. Prior to getting my Keurig, I would hunt down beans, grind them and brew them. But the Keurig can't be beat for convenience. The only downside is the ridiculously expensive K-cups. I do get mine from online sites such as 11th street coffee and occasionally at Bed Bath and Beyond when i have thier ubiquitous 20% off coupon.  A do it yourself K-cup seemed like a great idea. Unfortunately, this one did not work as well as expected.I did like that there are two cups. I was planning to reserve one for coffee and one for tea. Set up is easy and well illustrated on the box.  In explicably,the recommendation that you use an expresso grind is embossed on the black cap. It is hard to read and really,  couldn't this info been put on the box? Essentially you slide one of the disposable paper filters over the the black filter insert and then slip the green up over the paper filter.  You fill the cup with your tea or coffee and put the cap on. (Again, there is no guage of how much coffee to add.again, a suggestion on the box would have been appreciated.) Although the directions say to ""snap"" it on, it does not snap. It just lies on top. After brewing, you toss the paper filter and rinse the cup, insert and cap. Unfortunately, my machine, which is an older model, punched a hole through the filter resulting in a grounds filled, weak cup of coffee. (Again, while the box says it can be used with most Keurigs, it would have been helpful to include a list.)  I tried again, using two paper filters and less coffee.That resulted in fewer grounds in the coffee, but the brew itself was watery and weak. I see that some reviewers more determined than I performed surgery on the legs of the insert. Frankly, I have neither the inclination nor the energy to go that far. For something that was supposed to make my life easier, it has not. I hadn't bargained on fooling with filters and snipping the insert all for a less than satisfactory cup of joe.While I applaud the concept and think the name is cute, the actual execution leaves alot to be desired.",3.0

943,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B007JFXWRC,"Lipton Herbal Pyramid Blackberry Vanilla Tea Bags have a pleasant flavor with a nice tartness. It is caffeine-free because it isn't really tea but an herbal infusion so it's a good choice for a hot beverage in the evening.There is a hint of blackberry or raspberry but the predominant flavors to my palate are hibiscus and rose hip. The vanilla gives a nice scent but not a lot of flavor. It distinctly reminds me of Celestial Seasonings Wild Berry Zinger Herbal Tea. I don't think that the Wild Berry Zinger has the vanilla scent but it has been quite some time since I had any.My primary objections are that the bags seem to be made of some kind of plastic rather than a biodegradable material and that the manufacturer didn't bother to spell the ingredients properly.Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, rosehips (sic), sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current (sic) pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin (presumably as an emulsifier).Vanilla isn't listed as such but is no doubt included under the third-most predominant listed ingredient, natural flavors. It would certainly be good marketing to include it particularly since it is in the product name. This makes me suspect that it is actually a vanillin naturally-derived from fermentation of ferulic acid rather from the vanilla bean. If so, the depiction of a vanilla flower on the label is certainly deceptive.",4.0

In this, you fry an onion in olive oil (OK, I used butter), then fry the couscous before you cook it. Afterwards, you fluff it up to separate the grains.I made this with a chuck roast, so I used the broth to make the couscous itself. I was also making home grown green beans, so after steaming them, I added them to a fry pan with onions and more butter. and after they were tender, I stirred in the couscous for a final fry. I cut up the roast and stirred the meat into the couscous.It was, to put it mildly, delicious.Am I ""cheating?"" Nope, couscous, like rice and other grains is exactly that, a grain. When cooked properly using family recipes, it will be wonderful. But I would no sooner make plain couscous without butter, salt, and pepper than I would make plain rice and expect it to be tasty.This seven ounce package made plenty as a side dish for our family of four.If you are trying couscous for the first time, try to make it the same way you would work with rice.

The flavor is better and has less of an aftertaste.  Even with the chemicals, there are more natural flavors.

This might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be. However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial. This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always have a more muddled flavor.  Having tried many of the Switch flavors, I find this one, like the watermelon, a bit plain and unexciting for a drink which purports to ""switch"" my world around.  The flavor really reminds me of strawberry-kiwi Snapple, which isn't a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.

The peanut butter was more of a suggestion than a true flavor and the dark chocolate was thin and mild. Although it did seem to hold off cravings and hunger pangs, it did not excite my taste buds. I thought the calorie content was hefty for such a small bar. So while I might eat one again, I would not go out of my way to do so.",3.0
411,A1W415JP5WEAJK,B003EXVM66,"Many years ago I discovered the you can make lasagna (using any noodles) without cooking them first. Just add extra water around the edges and cover it with aluminum foil during the first 45 minutes of cooking.But there is a problem with making it this way, the pasta has lots of lovely curls along the edge which makes it hard to stack. It also is difficult to break to make it fit nicely in this pan.That's where this wonderful idea comes in. The lasagna noodles are flat. They fit nicely and evenly into the pan.If you are looking for a wonderful way to cut the time spent making lasagna, these are the perfect noodle for the perfect short cut.

Doing my cut and paste, I see that the single review posted when I created mine has a title which uses the exact same phrase!We go through a lot of hot and spicy sauces, condiments and salsas in this household and we've met the hottest salsas of all in our first jar of Arriba Red Salsa, Hot.  I'm not kidding, just thinking about it makes my mouth and tongue burn, but in a good way.  Tasting fresh, relatively thin in consistency, our only complaint is that the jar is difficult to open.  Without ourOXO Good Grips Jar Opener, I don't know that I would have been able to pop the top.  The batch we received has a best by date of more than a year, but it was difficult to find and read on the top edge of the glass jar.  I also think it's worth mentioning that despite the labeling of ""Gluten free,"" there is a teeny tiny print warning that this is, ""Made in a facility that uses milk, wheat, soy, egg, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, and crustaceans.""  So, if you're a celiac or allergic to any of the above, be forewarned by this consumer.The ingredient list is interesting in that the peppers are solely jalape&ntilde;o, and judging from the heat of the salsa, they don't skimp on the peppers.  Using an Aztec style of flame roasting the vegetables, the flavors are well married and produced a great salsa for cooking as well as dipping.  We've become hooked on this and it's been enjoyed by each person who's tasted it with the exception of a single lightweight.  It's interesting to me that sesame oil is used with no other oils, and I wonder if it is used in the fire roasting process or added to the salsa.  I'd guess that the it's in the roasting and not added to the mix.  Any way it's done, this is a tasty salsa, but the heat definitely overpowers any separation of flavors.  We really, really like it and would would like to try the Medium version for comparison.",5.0

However, I would have preferred the caramel in a block instead of having to unwrap twenty some individuals. Granted, that might be a fun enterprise for kids but I found it tedious.

Honey granules made from sugar and honey- I use honey powder in my baking, and it is made with honey and sugar, but honey is the first ingredient named on it, not the second. Malic acid- also fine, some of the tart of a good granny smith apple is malic acid, and malic acid is also what makes the tart in rhubarb.

I love hibiscus based teas, but this is supposed to be dragonfruit and peach. Maltodextrin made from corn- now that I'm not even sure why it's in here, it can be a mild sweetener, but isn't it supposed to be sweetened with honey? Sucralose- that's not even natural. Sucralose is the sweetener used by Splenda. Caramel color, then finally the dragonfruit and peach maybe? Because the very last ingredient is ""natural flavors"".So I was leery about trying it, but stirred it into 20 ounces of water (instructions say 16.9 ounces) and took a drink.It's sweet, super, super sweet, with a chemical flavor that is inescapable. It's not as bad as a lot of sucralose sweetened things, but you know it's not honey. There is a strong fruity flavor, but it's not identifiable as dragonfruit or peach. The green tea is also barely noticeable. You notice tart, fruit, and chemical sweetness.My kids aren't nearly as picky as I am, and they couldn't drink it either.

There was a pretty decent amount of Red Pepper Chunks too.Spicy Chorizo & Pulled Chicken with Black Beans- I wasn't as big on this option as the other 2 that I've tried.  It's a bit thicker and although I do like Black Beans, the flavor of the liquid was a bit overwhelming with the black bean flavoring.  The meats were good but the black bean flavor kinda overpowered it.  Wasn't bad, just wasn't one I'll be getting again.The Pouch- I really like the Microwavable Pouch that the soups comes in.  They're very easy and convenient to use.I would highly recommend the two soups that I've tried and I can't wait to try more of them.",5.0

But since Lipton makes instant ice tea that is drinkable, this seemed worth trying.It's a well balanced blend. The bright acid lemon flavor is stronger than lemon flavored ice tea and the tea flavor is still strong enough to come through. It is pretty sweet, which can sometimes be too much for me, but this just skirts that line between sweet and too sweet. My teens love it.We will be buying this again in the future.

973,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B007K5KAJY,"Energy drinks are typically something I avoid.  When I drank them, I was alert, but my heart would race and my mind was not focused.  Nawgan lemonade markets itself as a product to help stay sharp, though it also relies on caffeine.  That caffeine is from green tea extract, and it is 100 mg.  This is similar to a cup of coffee and hit me just right -- I felt alert without too much of a crash or absent mindedness.  To add a little nutritional value, B and E vitamins are also added.  I actually felt good after drinking Nawgan, and wouldn't mind drinking it again.  It does contain sucralose rather than natural sweetener, so that might be a deal breaker for those looking to avoid it.The flavor of energy drinks is often extremely harsh, but Nawgan is similar to a standard sugar-free lemonade drink.  Think Chik-Fil-A diet lemonade with the metallic flavor of a can and a bit of a chemical aftertaste.  This may not sound good, but for canned lemonade, I would rate it highly.Nawgan lemonade was a pleasant surprise, and it is easily my favorite caffeine-based energy drink.  It also makes a nice alternative to coffee or black tea during the hot summer months.",5.0

1603,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00C1CLQGC,I didn't really know what to expect when trying this rice seasoning mix but I my family loves rice and we are open to trying new things. It's very easy to prepare. First you add two tablespoons of oil to a sauce pan and add 1  cups of long grain rice. Stir it frequently and brown the rice and then add 3 cups of water and one packet of this seasoning. Next you bring it to a boil and then simmer for 18 minutes. The rice will thicken up nicely but will still have some extra liquid. So you remove it from the burner and let it sit for 10 minutes. It has turned out perfect for me and the rice didn't stick together at all. I am not real sure why this seasoning doesn't have better reviews. This may not be the healthiest seasoning since it contains a lot of salt but it tastes really good. My kids and I liked it a lot. I tried it with long grain white rice but I think I might try it with long grain wild rice next time because I think that might be even better.,4.0

The texture is soft, almost puffy.These chips do not contain artificial flavors, artificial colors, trans fat, or too much sugar, and are not greasy. The total sugar count is only three grams for each ounce, twenty-eight grams, or about ten percent. I have tried them for dipping with salsa, and as a snack with lunch. They are a little soft for guacamole, but can work for that too. The only downside is that they can become addictive.Popchips come in a variety of sizes and also multi-package boxes, so you may wish to do some price-comparison shopping on Amazon and other sites once you become a Popchips addict.",5.0

The chips are a bit thick with a coarse texture. The chips are salty but there is no clearly identifiable vegetable flavor. They are filling and I had no desire to scarf down the whole bag like I would with regular potato chips.These are ideal if you have food sensitivities or allergies and desire some crunch.

The package boasts that this is a one-to-one replacement for flour, and specifically states it can be used for bread making. After trying to make a pizza crust with it, I would say that's not an accurate statement.I made the dough as I normally would, but used this flour instead of my usual bread flour. The dough was much harder to handle - it stuck to my hands with the tenacity of wood glue. But, after working with it for a while, I was able to get it to a workable consistency, and set it aside to rise.It rose nicely, but still had a heavy consistency. I was expecting that, so I planned on doing a thin crust pizza. Since this has no gluten, you can (not surprisingly) forget about truing to stretch or toss the dough. The only way to deal with it is to roll it out like a pie crust. To make it easier to deal with, I rolled it out on a silicon baking liner, inverted the liner on the pizza screen, and peeled off the liner. Worked fine.I used a pizza screen rather than attempt to bake this directly on a oven stone as I normally would with a conventional pizza since I had no confidence that it would hold together. I thought a regular pan would result in a soggy crust, so went the screen route.It came out fairly crunchy, but the texture was not at all appealing. It was as if I tried to make a crust out of potato meal. Very bland taste as well. There's no structural integrity to the crust, so I couldn't pick of a piece and eat it by hand - just crumbled up.I'll give this 2 stars since it may be OK for some baked goods.

This is just a nice, flat distribution of equality between orange and hibiscus, and it makes for an exemplary tea.One thing this tea has going for it is, as a decaffeinated blend, it makes for a wonderful, hot nighttime tea, to enjoy before turning in for the night. This just might be my first hot tea of any sort that has come to garner my ""this could become a regular thing"" approval for a hot beverage. I absolutely love it.I have been so bold as to test the orange and chocolate theory, by having this hot herbal blend while nibbling on some chocolate Oreo cookies.

This might be a deal breaker to some people that don't mind the taste of an energy drink, as they want a bit more caffeine in their drink.In the end this is more for those who want something to drink that doesn't overload their system like a 5 Hour Energy or Monster beverage does. I'd rate this slightly higher except that the package promises a little more than what the average consumer would expect it to do: when you use the term ""energy"" in relation to beverages, most expect something along the lines of a Monster energy drink, and as such, would be disappointed by this.

The white cheddar is smooth and looks like it was dipped in the cheese coating. The sharp cheddar has a powder coating of cheese on it. The popcorn is very fresh and there are no hard kernels in the bag. You can see some parts of shell of the popcorn kernels but it doesn&#8217;t get stuck in your teeth like regular popcorn.I noticed how poorly many others have rated this popcorn and is really surprises me because I like it a lot and could munch on it all day long.

I was an instant fan, but some people, especially ""real"" tea drinkers didn't care for it much at all.  In fact, many of them considered it more to be a drink instead of a tea.  I got the Blackberry Vanilla from Amazon and was so pleased with it I decided to try a couple of other flavors.  I'm slowly working through the assorted flavors and today I tried the Orange Blossom Hibiscus for the first time.  The smell was quite enticing and because I tend to have a bit of a sweet tooth I added a small small dollop ofOrganic Blue Agave, another natural product that enhanced the fruit flavor of this tea.INGREDIENTS:Rosehips, orange leaves, orange peel, lemon peel, hibiscus flowers, lemon grass, licorice root, orange juice concentrate, orange pulp, natural flavor, sunflower lecithin.The Orange Blossom Hibiscus tea is caffeine free, something I appreciate, especially if I want something at night.  It's considered to be an herbal tea and is made with real pieces of orange.  It's a bit milder than the Blackberry Vanilla, but still not a strong tea.  If you enjoy fruit-flavored teas, or drinks as some people might call them you'll probably enjoy it.  When I opened the box it didn't have one of those marvelous smells like some of the other Lipton teas, but rather more of an herbal or tea-like scent rather than one heavily infused with orange. The tea drinker in my household, who is a fan of unsweetened green and black teas, didn't care for this flavor at all (he turns his nose up at all the pyramid teas I have).The little pyramid bags act similar to a tea ball infuser, allowing the tea leaves and other ingredients to float free in the water.  Undoubtedly, this only enhanced the flavor.  The Orange Blossom Hibiscus tea can either be served hot or cold.  Anyone who loves herbal or fruit-flavored teas and is interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, just might want to add the Orange Blossom Hibiscus tea to their list.

It's very sweet - this is far more like eating candy than eating popcorn. The coating has a good amount of cinnamon, and the cinnamon flavor comes through very well.I think it would be better if less coating was used so that the popcorn center could better balance the sweetness.

The mixture is so then that it mostly just cooks and drips off the chicken. It tastes decent but not as good as with the zesty Italian dressing that I normally use.

The other pro comment in using these is if you want to fix a smaller lasagna dish. There are much smaller than the regular noodles and you do not have to worry about trying to crack the larger noodles or cut them to size. Most of the time you cannot tell the difference between these and the noodles you prepare by boiling.

993,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B007OSBEVA,"I enjoyed this product overall, but I have to give this three stars rather than four for one good reason: this will be watered down depending on which Keurig machine you use. If you have a machine where you manually add the water cup by cup, then this is a great tea and I highly recommend it. I've had their basic tea bags and from past experience I can say that this is a good tea that's in keeping with their product line.However if you like a stronger cup and you have a machine that will not allow you to select the amount of water per cup, I recommend sticking to their tea bags. I found that a cup of this with the 12 ounces of water just wasn't strong enough for my tastes and I wish there was a way that this could have steeped for maybe a good 20 seconds longer. I'm not a huge fan of very strong teas, so if I found this too weak then I know that others will feel that this is almost like drinking water. You could probably get away with selecting the smaller water amounts, but I know that a lot of people will be wanting a nice big cuppa.Other than that, the taste of this is nice and I like that it's an alternative to my countless K-cups of coffee. When I got the chance to use this with the right amount of water, I really loved it. I just have to put this at three stars because I know that a lot of users will be stuck sticking with teabags rather than using the K-cup version of this. The brand is great and I think that if it had just a pinch more tea in the cup, this issue probably wouldn't really be a big thing.I know that others have reported seeing bits of tea leaf in their drink and I can see how this happens, as the water goes through a hole in the bottom of the K-cup. I'm used to loose leaf teas, so this didn't really bother me, though. I'm used to finding some stray tea bits in my cup when I use one of my tea balls.

I quite often change it up which can be done by using different oils (olive, canola, sesame, peanut) and by using different vinegars (red wine, apple cider, rice wine, white).  My favorite is usually a mix of olive oil, red wine and just a bit of balsamic.  Then all I have to do is add the seasoning mix and it's ready to go! Although it tastes even better a day later when the flavors have developed even more.  It's perfect on salad, both green and pasta; but it also works wonderfully as a marinade for meat.  Chicken and flank steak are just two that I've tried on the grill with great results.  Additionally the dry mix can also be used in recipes itself.  A little added to sour cream makes a good veggie dip or to your burgers for extra flavor.  Overall it's a great pantry item to have because of it's many tasty uses.",4.0

They are totally refreshing and, admittedly, much better than the soda I like to drink.  The ""to go"" packages are all over the place now and if you've been in a convenience store recently, you'll find them right near the water.  You'll also see this type of container up front, usually the Mio water enhancers.  It seems like everyone is getting in on the act, but I do like the on-the-go aspect.  This small bottle is easier to tote around and use than the packets.I can taste the honey and mango when I add a squirt to cold water, but the tea is somewhat glossed over.  Honey granules are a very popular sweetener, but so is Splenda.  In essence the reason these drinks are so sweet is because of the sucralose which is marketed under several names.  If you have problems with this, you can simply take a pass.  All of the information is not hidden, but here on the pictures for everyone to take a look at.Personally, I do love the taste of these ""teas,"" which taste more like fruit drinks than they do tea.  The real tea drinker in my house actually liked the taste, but does prefer his real tea with his cookies.

1521,A3VI2VETB90ZG5,B00BDFNRG0,"I always expected more from Orville Redenbacher, so perhaps he was having a bad day when he came up with this batch. This stuff is supposed to have a White & Sharp Cheddar flavor. Upon inspection of the ingredients, the cheeses from which it is flavored show cheddar and blue cheese. Having opened the bag to see what the fuss is all about, I would guess that if any cheese was used, perhaps the ingredients are reflective of their way of wording that they made it from cheddar cheese that had turned blue. This is not really a treat, by any means.As I look closely at these big, crunchy kernels of popped corn, I see that there are two different colors of kernels, though not as pronouncedly different than as shown on the bag. I have the lighter kernels, which have an acceptable, yet not delectable flavor. Then I have the darker kernel, with a brownish undercoating below the cheese; these are the apples that spoil the bunch, and in saying that, I am unintentionally giving a bad name to spoiled apples. The dark kernels taste horrible. It's like the brown undercoat is made of a crisp-hardened solution of dirty dish water...from a condemned restaurant!With five servings per bag, and with nine percent of the daily allowance of sodium in each of those servings, I would rather use up my sodium for the day on something yummy instead, like eating an entire box of beef-flavored boxed rice, which I do on occasion. To throw that allowance away on Orville Redenbacher's Pop Crunch White & Sharp Cheddar Mix flavored popcorn snack, which has no pleasantly redeeming qualities about it, would be a sure waste of a day's worth of sodium.It is edible, and I can become accustomed to the odd flavor, but still not delighted with it. It leaves an odd aftertaste, as well. I have to give it only two stars, as I simply do not like this product. I find no satisfaction from eating it, really.",2.0
0,A36WGHR8TO5DKT,B00099XNG0,"Many reviewers have already commented on the fact that this mix is tasty.  I find it difficult to describe, because it is definitely chocolatey, and sweet, but yet it's not quite like eating candy or cookies etc.  It will handle multiple types of snacking cravings whether you want chocolate, candy, sweet in general, crunchy, crispy, or sweet-salty etc.One thing that surprised me was that all of the pieces in the mix, except the candy drops, are basically sized to match the Chex squares, so they are smaller than I had anticipated.  This is a big plus for me, as I find most ""bite-sized"" products to be more like ""3-bite-sized"", and this mix is actually really bite-sized.  This makes it easy to eat and it also is very charming.  I think it would be a good option for children, to whom you could give a small amount in their lunch/bento box or as a snack, and they will feel they are getting a treat without eating too much junk.The mix contains adorable, crispy, and tasty tiny chocolate-coated pretzels.  There are mini chocolate cookies, uncoated and unfilled, which resemble the outer cookie of an Oreo.  The mix contains some M&M; like chocolate candies.  It also contains two different types of Chex pieces.  One is lightly coated in a nice cocoa flavor, the other with a bit thicker, sweeter vanilla coating.  There are comparatively few of the vanilla Chex pieces; they serve just to add counterpoint to the chocolate.This mix is labelled ""dark chocolate"" but it isn't too strong or bitter.  Everything is fresh, crispy/crunchy etc. as it should be.  The flavor intensities of the different types of pieces keeps the mix from coming off like a variant of bridge mix.  It is essentially a simple idea that results in an unusually different snack.The bag seems on the small size, but this mix has some punch to it in terms of snacking satisfaction; I'm finding that one bag gives me about 8 servings.",5.0

Water is my drink of choice.This Essentia pH balanced water has an advantage over plain water when it comes to refreshment. I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out. In every bit of honesty, I savored this bottle of water. I chugged, at a reasonable pace, every drop. I found it delicious, smooth and refreshing.Sure, it's more than just water; actually, it's purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide. Like most commercial beverages, this one has a formula as well, and it works out great.In the end, it's still water, but there is something favorable about water with a pH of 9.5. When chilled, this stuff is remarkably enjoyable. If you're a water connoisseur and you buy bottled water anyway, then definitely try Essentia - it's very nice.",5.0
144,A2MNB77YGJ3CN0,B001AHFVHO,"... and these do!!Wow!  I was really surprised at how good these chips are.  These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.

301,A29313797NGT9L,B0026ZYZ7Q,"This tea comes in sealed individual bags, and the moment you open one, the vibrant smell of Cardamom, whatever combination that is, comes to the forefront. Enjoyable, pleasant, it did not appear to be the kind of tea requiring any milk, like some of the English teas, like the breakfast varieties, allow. Like most flavored teas, this particular flavor is perhaps intended for a particular crowd that favors this kind over another flavor. I found it interesting, even refreshing, but certainly not the kind of tea that I would drink on a regular basis.Over the years I have come to appreciate the many varieties of tea in our world, and through trials and errors, I have come to recognize that the best of the best, is in the taste of the beholder, or better still, drinker of tea. Loose Tea, where one gets to brew the right amount at the right temperature, and hopefully of a particular variety that defies sometimes description, has been the best option, if only a little more tedious to prepare than just placing a tea bag in very hot water.Tea bags are a convenience, but seldom reach the heights that loose tea and brewing it, achieve. The Cardamom Pu'erh Tea Bags, 16-Count, is maybe a holiday type tea, that only once or twice a year one would sip and appreciate, but it is not an above average tea. Like always, Amazon came through with flying colors, and as a whole we did appreciate the chance to taste this tea. Did not appear to contain much caffeine, as I am sure it was intended, but I have always leaned to what one would called a strong cup of tea. One time when I brewed more than what was needed in loose tea, I found that tea can pack as much, if not more caffeine, than strong coffee. Had the jitters and shaking hands for better part of an hour, the same jitters, I suppose, strong coffee is also able to dispense, and was very surprised how strong this tea was when not brewed carefully.I love a tea with a lot of heart, that wakes up the intense feeling of the experience, and never fails to cheer up the soul. With, or without milk, I find tea every bit as good as great coffee.For the flavor tea inclined, perhaps this is a great tea. For someone who still searches among the many varieties, this tea earned a 3.5 Stars rating.",3.0

177,A2MNB77YGJ3CN0,B001FA1SSM,"... but I'm not one of them.It was just ""OK.""  The flavor of the flakes is passable, but WAY too sweet for my taste.  They are also very HARD (I wouldn't say ""crisp"" -- they're too thick to be crisp).  They do soften a bit in milk, but the huge amount of sugar gives them a rather slimy exterior on a crunchy interior.  If you're not put off by that, then the flakes may work for you.  On the plus side, they're high fiber.The ""summer berry"" part of the cereal includes freeze-dried strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries.  These are recognizable thick slices of strawberry and whole raspberries (I still haven't found a blackberry anywhere in the package).  The problem is -- once ""reconstituted"" by milk, the strawberries become spongy and almost tasteless, while the raspberries become very sour tasting.  This actually helps offset the cloying sweetness of the flakes, but overall just doesn't work for me.I give this three stars because it DOES have some flavor and high fiber, and it will definitely appeal to some tastes.I'm a cereal ""junky,"" and have it for breakfast 4-5 days a week.  My favorites include frosted mini-wheats (to which I add dried cranberries), and low-sugar granolas.  So I'm not averse to ""sweet"" cereals.

A little research taught me that chia seeds are an ancient grain from South America, most often used as a drink.  They fit into a healthy diet because one tablespoon supplies 4 grams of fiber, 2.5 grams of protein, and only 4 grams of carbs and 62 calories.  They work as a gel-like binder in baking (replacing some of the eggs, but you'll need to add a little extra liquid), and help maintain a fuller feeling to avoid overeating.I've been adding chia to my baking (brownies are divine with chia!) and to smoothies especially to benefit from the Omega 3 and 6 found in them.  These Viva Labs raw chia seeds are everything I expect - certified organic, non-GMO, gluten free, vegan and easy to use.

1333,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00A0GT9Z6,This cook top cleaner cleaning system will clean either glass or ceramic stove tops. I used it on our glass stove top that is always a little difficult to clean.  It includes one handle and 4 packages of cleaning pads. There are 6 pads per package so the set comes with a total of 24 cleaning pads. The pads come in a re-sealable pouch so they stay nice and moist. The pads are very thick and strong and don't rip apart at all while you are scrubbing with them. The pads are wet and contain a cleaning and polishing solution. It's very simple to use but requires a couple minutes of scrubbing for best results. As you start to scrub the stove top will get white and pasty. If you have spots that are burnt on then it may take a couple of minutes to get it nice and clean. After thoroughly scrubbing your stove top you are supposed to use a towel and polish it but I found it better to take a wet towel and wipe away most of the solution and then polish it. I can honestly say that my stove top looks the best that it has looked in years and I really like this system. It doesn't look perfect but pretty darn close. I will most certainly continue using these in the future because they work so well and they don't cost much at all. I will probably only need to use it every other week or so to remove the spots that regular cleaning doesn't.

540,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B004E4EBMG,"I try to drink at least 8 8 oz. glasses of water a day, and I don't know about you, but water can get a little boring.  So, occasionally I like the flavors you can buy to put in the waters to make them more fun.  If they taste great I'm more apt to get my water in.  I have never tried a liquid version of a water enhancer, but thought these looked interesting.  The container is small, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and if you do a squirt of flavor for every 8 oz. you should get 24 uses out of the container.  The nice thing though is that you can tailor it yourself, more if you like a deep flavor and less if you just want a hint.  That's one thing you can't do neatly with the dry versions.  I also like that the size is small.  With this size I could have it in my desk at work to pump my water up a notch or two.  The flavor, mango peach is delicious-not too sweet, just perfect and smells tropical.The only drawback I could see is that you need to be careful in using it and have it right over your bottle, the color I'm sure would stain and the liquid comes out pretty forcefully with a squeeze.  Other than that, I was pleased I had a chance to try this and would definitely consider buying this and telling others about it.Great idea in a little package!",5.0

That promise of quick and easy macaroni and cheese is about the only thing that's exciting about this product.  The reality definitely did not live up to the promise.  According to the instructions it needs to be filled with water up to the fill line, but there was no line on the package- inside or out.  I guessed and filled halfway between the dried pasta and the top.  It appears that it may have been too much water, because the result was a bit watery.  More problematic, though, was that it didn't taste anything like macaroni and cheese.  The sauce had no real flavor or cheesiness to it, and the pasta was mushy and fell apart easily.  It's true that I may have used a bit too much water, but the cup is not very big, so it can't have been all that much extra.  The end result was not so gross that I spit it out- I did finish the cup.  It isn't anything I'd go out of my way to eat again.",2.0

801,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B005VOOKMY,"Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a ""pot"" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole ""organic, fair trade"" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)",4.0
317,A1YJMG0QJXZLD4,B0026ZYZ7Q,"I would first like to say I am a big fan of Pu'erh tea.  I buy it here on Amazon in large cakes that I have every morning.So when Amazon offered this tea in a bag I grabbed it, I thought that it would be so nice to carry my favorite tea with me when I go out with friends to lunch etc.I followed the instructions, steeping it for about 5 minutes in boiled water.  I was a little surprised to find the taste was extremely mild, not necessarily a bad thing but I felt like I wanted more flavor.  I could hardly taste the Ginger, so much so that I added my own slices of fresh Ginger to get the true flavor.  That lack of flavor  disappointed me somewhat.I do like the portability of the bags and will use all of them but I am not sure I will purchase them again even though the price is really reasonable at .43 cents per bag, not bag considering what the restaurants charge for one.Numi is a very nice brand and they are very concerned with their foot print on the planet.  Everything including the tea bag itself, the box and everything that is presented is bio degradable.  It is also 100% organic and Non Gmo all of these are pluses.From my own experience I find that Pu erh tea does have an effect on weight management.But it is not true weight loss it is water weight loss.. If I do not drink it for awhile I gain about a pound or two and when I resume the tea I lose about a pound or two.  I do not drink it for the weight loss but for the good feeling I get when I drink it.  There is a calm that comes with drinking this tea, as it contains some measure of L Theanine.  L Theanine is a calming substance that I take on a semi regular basis.  I have lupus and often get a jittery stomach and this tea helps to sooth that.If you are the type that enjoys a nice strong tea then pass this up, but if you like a soft smooth soothing tea then you are in for a treat.I also tried the Cardamom Pu erh teas and will give a very similar review for that one.",4.0

1904,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00E6OIXM8,"I tried Martinson Joe's coffee K-Cups for the first time about a year ago and have tried several different types since then. I have liked all of them really well so I was happy to try a few new flavors. Generally speaking their coffee is bold and flavorful which is what I typically like. I recently tried the Mint N Mocha, Vanilla Velvet and Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me flavors and these are my thoughts on each of them.Mint N MochaI love mint and I drink Caf&eacute; Mocha almost daily whether it's from a coffee shop or made at home. So this new flavor of coffee almost sounded like it was made just for me and I was jumping with joy to try it. The coffee itself is bold and flavorful. Martinson Joe's coffee is very consistent about the quality and strength of their coffee and I like that. The mint flavor just isn't exactly what I was expecting. I was thinking it would be a more subtle flavor but it's really strong and almost overwhelming. When you brew a cup of coffee everyone in the house can just about smell it. My first couple of cups it really turned me off but as I have drank it more and more I have apparently become used to it. I like it better now than at first and I find myself picking this coffee before others even though I complain about the strength of the mint. I think this coffee has the potential to be great if they would make the mint flavor less intense and smoother somehow. I think that would make for a better overall cup of coffee. If they made it right I could see myself getting hooked on this coffee.Vanilla VelvetI enjoy vanilla flavored coffee so I gave Martinson Joe's Vanilla Velvet a try. I wasn't quite sure what to expect the taste to be like. When brewing it you can smell the vanilla from across the room and it smells just like any other vanilla coffee. Like normal the coffee is bond and full flavored. It seems like you can smell the vanilla more than you can taste it for some reason. It may just be that the vanilla flavor is slightly hidden behind the cream flavor that put in this to make it taste smoother. This coffee is good but I think I prefer a regular vanilla flavored coffee to this.Hazelnut Cr&egrave;meHazelnut coffee is another favorite of mine. I usually like just about any type of coffee that has Hazelnut flavor. So I was anxious to try Martinson Joe's Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me. They start with their typical high quality, bold and flavorful coffee and add Hazelnut. I drink their regular Hazelnut coffee all the time and it's a favorite of mine. But with this flavor they add cream of some sort and I don't really care for the taste of the cream and it sort of just distracts me from enjoying the nice Hazelnut flavor. I think this coffee is ok but it's not one of my favorites. I think I will stick to their regular Hazelnut coffee and keep it simple.",4.0

I would say that the flavor of Nutella is smoother and more subtle, and for lack of a better way to describe it, the chocolate in this spread does not taste as expensive as that in Nutella.  The consistency is good and it starts to melt when spread on a piece of warm toast, which is nice.",4.0

133,A3VI2VETB90ZG5,B0016B9FSU,"In the midrange from what I have seen of price for a comparable size, this one-pound can of certified organic coconut oil is the way cook. Neutral in flavor, I love to use coconut oil on pan-fried foods, especially coconut or battered shrimp, because it always results in a lighter texture, more satisfying, crisper fried coating. I will finish my microwave burritos with it on occasion, but because of its price, when compared with other vegetable oils or shortenings, I try to be conservative by saving the coconut oils for my more exquisite fried foods.This is not health food, no oil is. It contains fourteen grams of fat per tablespoon serving, but perhaps these are the ""good fats,"" supposing medium chain triglycerides, lauric acid and caprylic acid is desirable.I have enjoyed coconut oils before, and Jarrow Formulas offers an exceptional product at a fair price. It melts down transparently beautiful. It seems to withstand higher heat than butter, margarine, shortening and vegetable oils do.I recommend keeping coconut oil on hand to add a lighter crisp to either baked or fried food, as it does make a noticeable difference. It stiffens when refrigerated, so if used regularly it may as well stay out. I am very happy with Jarrow Formulas certified organic coconut oil.",5.0

I also occasionally add some to the dog's food to make his coat shiny. I love that coconut oil is ready to use right out of the jar, and it's shelf stable for years without refrigeration. I thought I'd try this ""manna"" and see if we liked it as much as regular coconut oil.Like regular coconut oil, the manna has a very nice coconut fragrance.  Like some of the other reviewers, I was a little surprised to see that it's very hard and solid in the jar.  It reminded me of wax or soap, the way I could scratch off little ribbons with a spoon.  I ate some that way and liked it despite the slight grittiness. I tried some on an english muffin in place of butter - I had to leave scraped chunks on top and melt it in the microwave to get it to spread.  I know the directions say to heat it in a pan of hot water before using it, but who has time to do that every day?The bottom line is that I'll stick with Nutiva coconut oil for daily use.

I used a package of chicken- I find that thin-sliced breasts work best, as one needs to cook the chicken through before adding the sauce.  Non-thin cut breasts probably need to be pounded first.  I added chopped scallions and mushrooms to mine, and they went along nicely.  The chicken and sauce went nicely over a bed of rice- broccoli complemented the flavors nicely.  The flavor of the sauce is not as explicitly Asian-inspired as I would have expected (seeing as it is sesame-ginger, I was expecting it to taste more like an Asian dish).  Still it was tasty, and it was easy to make, and I could definitely see myself making this again in the future.",4.0

They are perhaps too crumbly, being very good in producing crumbs.

Palm oil is not the worst oil in the world to consume, but also not the best.  Despite the package promise of ""sharp cheddar,"" the cheese flavor is not very sharp, medium at best.

That is, it comes with a pre-determined mix of spices.  If you like it, fine, but if you do not like it, the dish has little value.  I think that it has too much salt.  A big advantage of pasta is that it is the raw material of so many dishes.  You can add anything you like in quantities that you like.

Even the potato flavor is really bland.The texture isn't a smooth puree like a typical &#34;cream of&#34; soup; it is filled with what resemble mashy bits of baked potato.  That doesn't ruin it, but I'd prefer the smooth style, or at the most have a little texture from some bacon bits.The product design is thus:  You have a nice, sturdy cup, with a somewhat non-spill red cap.  Shake the cup to mix; remove the red cap; peel off a foil seal; heat in the microwave for 1-2 minutes; let stand for 1 additional minute in the microwave; then replace red cap.Note that the cup retains a metal ring around the lip, which personally unnerves me as I don't like putting anything with metal on it into the microwave.  I assume that, if Campbell's markets it as microwaveable, then it must be okay.  I haven't had one spark or catch fire.  Yet.The cup does not get too hot to hold, and the red cap works well for drinking the soup, although I wouldn't rely on it in the non-spill department.  Note that the cup is filled to the very brim, which means you have to handle it carefully to avoid spilling during preparation.  There is no room to add any extras (like, something that will give it flavor).  You have to consume enough of the soup to create space if you want to add anything to it.On the plus side:  It's filling; doesn't taste very chemically; has only 130 calories; is easy to stash at work or wherever; and if you are dieting, you could have this, and possibly something like crudites, fruit, or a salad with it, and still stay under 200 calories for a meal, which is excellent on a diet.

699,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B004YV80O4,"In our house, I've been barred from EVER buying Hamburger Helper.  I suppose that's what happens when you cook from scratch for a bunch of boys nightly!  So, when I mentioned that we were going to try this, the number of moans and groans almost outweighed the sound of the hamburger cooking in the skillet.  But, were we ever in for a surprise.  This stuff is awesome!  It actually includes a large packet of smooth Velveeta cheese to mix in with the entree and just that one element really makes it go over the top in taste.  Mind you, if you'd like to save the calories from the cheese packet, the entree tastes great without it.My only complaints are: 1), it's a bit salty.  This is particularly heightened after adding that packet of cheese.  It's not over the top like some soups can be, but it's definitely a negative.  If you're on a salt-controlled diet, this might be an issue. 2). The actual serving size of the package is small.  And I mean, VERY small.  If you have a family of 3, then each individual would get one serving.  Any larger than that, then you're in trouble unless you have VERY young children.  If you have a hungry husband and sons, you'll wind up buying 3 boxes to actually make enough to fill them up.  My suggestion: add a salad with meat, along with a vegetable and some healthy bread and that helps considerably.  In addition, add something like a can of diced tomatoes to this dish and use ground turkey or chicken to make it healthier.  Milk to drink always helps too.  There is enough sauce to add an additional 1/2 pound of meat to the dish, along with the tomatoes, and the cheese sauce can cook a bit longer in the pan to make it more ""runny"" to infuse with the additional ingredients.So, this is definitely a ""keeper"" in this house.  I about fell off my chair when I heard a ""Yum!""  But, Velveeta has been creating ""Yums"" for years and I am not surprised that this dish is in keeping with their history. Highly recommend!",5.0

I had every intention of ordering the decaf Earl Grey because I love bergamot, but my order was hijacked by an unleashed desire to try something new.  Most decaffeinated beverages produce a different flavor and strength from their unprocessed counterpart, but the full mouth flavor remains intact with this tea.  It is a combination of black teas and nothing else, no flavorings, no additions, and this is a wonderfully satisfying beverage for a purist.  The bag which is like the ""flo-through"" Lipton bags I remember from years ago is attached to a white cotton thread which appears to be knotted at the bag and the paper tag and there is no metal staple.  Each bag is in a fully sealed smooth paper pouch which is also biodegradable, another advantage.  I thought Twinings used light paper envelopes, so that was a fantastic surprise which I appreciate.  I have drunk it with a Splenda but intend to have it with skim milk as well tomorrow.  It was perfect with Trader Joe's Orange Cardamom cookies.

As I sauteed this, the whole kitchen filled with the aroma of roasted garlic, making me feel like a super chef.Then, while the couscous cooked, I steamed the broccoli. I had chopped it into small pieces knowing I would be mixing the two. When both were done, I mixed them and served them as a side along with butter, salt, and pepper.If you have never made couscous, I can recommend this brand as easy to cook (it actually doesn't require you to saute it first, I just like it that way), and is filled with delicious flavorings.",5.0

Almost cloyingly so, actually. Perhaps it's just that my tastes in chocolate have shifted over the years and I prefer more of a bitter taste to counteract the sweet caramel, but I kind of found myself ambivalent over this. It's not so awful that I'd toss the box, but I can say that I'd probably skip the milk chocolate variety of this and go for the SC products that feature dark chocolate. Sweet fiends will absolutely love this with a passion and if you're in the mood for something that'll hit your sweet tooth like Gallagher smashing a watermelon, this is the lower calorie chocolate I'd recommend.Texture-wise, this was a hit. The chocolate was nice and soft, with there being just enough gooey caramel to give it that ""melt in your mouth"" texture without it getting gooshy. It's a good size too. It's thin and wide, so it makes you feel like you're eating more chocolate than you actually are.I just wish that I liked this more. It's far too sweet for my tastes.

This oil is particularly great for eating as a supplement, both because of the bright, fresh flavor and the pleasant texture at room temperature.

I gave the Plus option a try and my family of 4 decided that we like it a little better than the Classic option.  That shocked me because we aren't typically good about liking healthier options.  I'd rather eat smaller potions of something I love than bigger portions of something that I don't really like the taste of.Tonight we tried the Whole Grain options.  None of us really cared for it.  It was edible, we ate it, but we just weren't big on it.  We all said we wouldn't want it again.  The taste was nothing like the classic and the texture wasn't to our liking either.  It was a bit on the rough side rather than being smooth.  I normally don't mind Whole Grain products.  I actually really like Whole Grain bread so I was kinda surprised that I didn't care for this.  I can say that I don't like Whole Wheat products and this seemed to fit into a category like that for me.  Just wasn't something I'd ever really choose to eat.Thin Spaghetti is what I choose most often but we have the normal Spaghetti noodles often too so it was a good comparison for us.

1094,A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,B00934S312,"Saying that something tastes good for being gluten free is not much of a  compliment. This product promises a quick and easy gluten free substitution in everyday recipes. However, my results left much to be desired and successful baking with this product requires adjustment. First, I found that spices, flavorings and leavening agents all had to be increased. Adding guar gum or xanthan help when making breads or muffins. Rule of thumb is 1/8 a teaspoon per cup of flour. Less is more so resist the temptation to dump in a lot. Substituting an egg or egg whites for a half cup of liquid boosts the protein content and helps your dough hold its shape.As with much gluten free cooking, practice makes perfect. On its own, this product is fine for breading things and seems to work best in recipes that have high moisture and sugar content. It would have been helpful if they included some tips and techniques on the package in addition to the recipes they share. While my dogs enjoyed my first batch of hockey pucks I was annoyed. Still if you are committed to a gluten free lifestyle, it will be worth you time and effort to experiment and adjust your favorite recipes accordingly.

It was just odd.Brownie Crunch- I didn't find this bar to be much different from the Chocolate Espresso.  Didn't like the flavor at all.  Not much like a brownie in my opinion and there was no crunch.Dark Chocolate- Although I liked the dark chocolate coating, I still didn't care for the inside.Chocolate Fudge-  This one wasn't as bad as the others but I still wouldn't say it was good.  It was just more edible.  Coating wasn't bad and the inside is the same as the rest, not good.I have some other flavors to try and although I'm hoping I'll find one of those to be more to my liking, I'm starting to think that's not going to happen.Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend any of the bars that's I've tried.",2.0

I have a giant Tupperware container that keeps them fresh.

1902,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00E6OIXM8,"I had an overall mixed opinion of this product. Part of what makes coffee so great for me is the taste and smell. The taste of this was good, but I have to say that the smell sort of initially put me off.The scent here after the coffee is made is really artificial smelling. I know that this has artificial flavoring, but this smells like some of the cheap chocolate and/or mint lip glosses you'd get from the store. It doesn't smell so bad that you'd avoid it, but the artificial scent here made me extremely wary about how this would taste. I wasn't expecting anything overly good from it at this point.Luckily, this tastes far FAR better than it smells. The artificial tinge to the drink is still there, but it's not as bad as I was expecting it to be. I think that the mint is sort of what pushes the artificial taste for the most part. It's nice with creamer and sugar, so the taste isn't as big of an impediment as the smell is. The overall taste reminded me of a cup of cocoa even with the slight artificial taste.Overall this isn't bad.

I have to admit that part of my fascination with the Crispy Green products has to be the texture of freeze dried foods, something people will either love or hate.

There's just something about them being chewy that always sort of irritates me.I have to say that I'm not entirely fond of the dried tangerines. I don't dislike them and I can see myself buying them in the future, but I do have to be in the mood for them. The texture is interesting and the taste isn't bad, but I just can't get past a bit of disappointment when I compare them to eating a non-dried tangerine.

I can't recommend those enough.These are a bit expensive so they might not be an everyday snack for all purchasers, but it's one I'd recommend to others- if only because they don't add sugar to it like you'd find in most traditionally dried fruits, which is a pet peeve of mine.",4.0

I prefer the thinner spaghetti even though there really is no discernible difference in taste.If you are looking for a way to integrate some whole grains and fiber into your family's diet without anyone being the wiser, this is the way to go.

1327,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B009WPKGQC,"As I adapted to Tabasco, I had to add more and more to get a decent amount of heat and pepper flavor.  I eventually gave it up because my food was all beginning to taste like vinegar, and switched to powdered cayenne.  More recently, I have discovered other hot sauces, which have less vinegar flavor than American hot sauces often do.  Gringo Bandito has a nice blend of pepper flavors, with a sweet background of habanero and not too much vinegar, that still feels like a traditional American hot sauce.  It is a big upgrade to Tabasco, in my opinion, and adds punch without too much acidity.",5.0

I'd stopped for two reasons: the first was that I was just getting tired of tuna kits and the second was that over time these just didn't taste as good as they initially did. I can't honestly tell you if that was a result of the company changing the formula or just my taste buds screaming out for me to try something different for lunch. I had this come up as a product trial, so I thought I'd take a little trip down pre-fab food memory lane to see if I liked this as much as I initially did. For the most part, I did and I'll likely buy this again sometime in the future.The good is that this is quick and easy. You don't have to mix anything, which puts it a little ahead of the kits where you have to mix everything yourself. This won't allow you to control the level of taste, but at the same time you don't have to worry about wasting time mixing or making a mess. You trade some things for the convenience. It's also fairly filling. It won't take the place of a full meal, but it'll be a good option for those times that you don't have the option to bring something that would need refrigeration or big lunchboxes.Taste-wise, this was OK. It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever had as far as tuna goes, but then for a pre-mixed option this is fairly good. I'll be honest: nothing will ever taste as good as the things you or others make fresh. This is still fairly tasty and good enough that I ate the remainder that was left over from the crackers. If it wasn't good then I wouldn't have finished this. I'd recommend this as a quick snack or a portable mini-meal for anyone on the run. It's good enough that I'm reminded that this is an option out there and I'll buy this from the store in the future.",3.0

The idea is that in the time that it takes you to boil a handful of pasta, drain it, add a dash of tomato/hot sauce or cheese, and then serve it, you can measure water and/or milk, boil the contents of the bag of pasta, drain it (it was a little watery), and serve it without adding your own ingredients, except perhaps for the margarine that the bag suggests. Margarine? Really! But wait, you have not saved any time, and certainly you have not saved any money either.

1085,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B0091146V8,I have mixed feelings about the Melitta Javajig Reusable Coffee Filter System. There are some good things about the system and there are some bad things as well.The good part... I think these filters are easy to use and work well. I haven't had any grinds in my coffee or any broken filters yet. They work very well and brew a perfectly fine cup of coffee. I have used the washable k-cup filters for years now and have liked using them but it is a pain washing out the filter. However the filter lasts for hundreds of uses with no additional cost other than the original purchase price. With these filters all you have to do it throw away the filter and quickly rinse off the plastic frame and lid. It works well and is pretty easy to use.The bad part... The cost of these filters is extremely high. For example I can buy a pack of 100 full size coffee filters at most any grocery store for about 2 dollars. These tiny little filters are about a tenth the size of a full size filter but they cost about 4 times as much.That being said I would really consider using this system all the time but only if the filters were substantially less to purchase.,3.0

One good thing I'd like to say is that the slight butter flavor doesn't taste super fake like other seasonings.  I rather have a subtle but more real butter flavor than a pungent artificial butter flavor.  So from that standpoint, this is a better choice without the calories of real butter.",3.0

Just flip the cap, tip into your beveage and squeeze, one or two squeezes does the trick. Click the top back on to secure.  Despite the lack of natural ingredients, the flavor was pleasantly peachy.  It was not too sweet and I did not notice any heavy chemical aftertaste.  I have tried it in water, plain seltzer water for a nifty peach soda, iced tea and hot tea.  The flavor provided a nice change.  The bottle is small enough to pop into a backpack or purse and when closed properly does not leak.

Unlike other brands I have tried, these turn out great...no off flavor or unwanted crunch. My understanding is that oven ready noodles are precooked at the factory and dehydrated. The sauce rehydrates them during baking and the end result is a flavorful noodle that is not gummy. Covering the pan seems to help soften them. Thinner than traditional noodles, these are flat and smooth not  pleated like other no boil products. Be generous with the sauce. The recipe on the box (that is actually pretty good)  can be used as a guide for adjusting your own recipe.Fast and good, these noodles have found a home in my pantry.  Recommended.",5.0

36,A353U0L2HAMSHV,B000F3Q0QK,"Whether you're preparing an appetizer, side dish, main course or dessertFischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)is a wonderful item to have on hand.I originally ordered this without realizing that it did contain seeds.  Unfortunately I am the type that buys seedless jams, so I was definitely worried that I wouldn't like it.  Upon receiving my order, it looked as though it was a very minimal amount so I decided to give it a try.  Wanting to use recipes that have been tested with this sauce I headed to the Fischer & Wieser website.  There I found three different ones that looked good and would allow me to taste the range of possibilities for this particular sauce.My first choice was raspberry creamed chicken for dinner and it was delicious! The flavor was very nice and I think the cream toned down some of the chipotle's heat which my son wouldn't have normally liked.  Then for dessert we decided to go easy and drizzle some onto vanilla ice cream.  Simple, but tasty when combined together.  The other recipe I will try soon is the raspberry chipotle cheese ball.  It's a take on the sauce poured over cream cheese that everyone has mentioned, but this mixes both together and then you roll it in nuts.  I'm taking it to a super bowl party and hope that it'll be an instant hit. *Edit 2/2/09 - Okay it was a hit!  Everyone asked me what was in the cheese ball and they were all surprised when I said it was just cream cheese and the Razzpotle sauce. I used a soup bowl lined with saran wrap for the mold and then after it was chilled to firm up, I covered it with toasted chopped pecans - So easy!Overall this is a very versatile sauce that I will continue stocking in my pantry.  At first the price seemed a bit high, but when I thought about the price of fresh raspberries I changed my mind. The only thing keeping me from giving this sauce 5 stars would be those seeds!  Although they didn't bother me enough to keep me from eating it, it was enough to say there is room for improvement in my opinion.",4.0

I insisted that I had to review it as it was intended. After that first trial of Side Mates, which turned out fantastically, I then thought, okay...I'll review it however it is prepared. So I gave in and green-lighted the broth-based method with an exhausted ""go ahead."" This was not the best thing to do. When you're cooking a boxed dish that is already seasoned, when you start adding more flavor to it, the results will be overwhelming, and that is what happened here. I knew I was right, but I wasn't going to say anything. I just let it go and said ""mmm,"" and nodded my head up and down.I could tell the base flavor of the Tuscan Medley was a fine zesty blend. I only wish I would have insisted on using water, and not broth on this one, so that it would not have been so ""heavy.""

Its microwave convenience dictates its price, so keep in mind that there are less expensive [and more healthful] alternatives from other packaging for stovetop preparation.It does not taste bad, but this processed consumable could benefit from fresher ingredients. The soup was an alright accompaniment to our smoked tri-tip and baked potato meal, though any processed side will bring a home-cooked meal down a notch.The Red Pepper and Smoked Gouda flavor is acceptable, yet the peels of the small bits of either tomato or pepper have a cellophane-like toughness about them.Pay close attention to the nutrition label on the back of the package, and keep in mind that each pouch contains two servings. It is for this reason that I would be careful about choosing these for children to use as an afterschool snack. The Red Pepper and Smoked Gouda flavor has an astonishing forty-five percent per serving of saturated fat, which comes in at ninety percent saturated fat for the entire fourteen-ounce package...and the cholesterol!The different flavors have different amounts of things to look out for - the Chicken & Quinoa with Poblano Chilies has no saturated fat, and only eight percent per serving of cholesterol - yet both soup flavors that I reference in this review contain two-thirds the recommended daily allowance of preservative sodium per package.Although I am accustomed to freshly whipped up soups, there are many prepared soups that I am just as happy to eat, especially when convenience is a consideration. Personally, and for nutritional reasons, I will choose other packaged soups as I desire.This product takes advantage of the hungry, lazy-to-cook teenager, as is evident by the goofy portraits on the package.

1324,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B009WPKGQC,"I grew scotch bonnet peppers and keep them in the freezer, using them only when my hands are protected by gloves.  I like heat but I love flavor.  This sauce is a really tasteful blend of peppers, spices and mojo prepared in a base of vinegar and water that is wonderfully successful as a medium heat hot sauce that will rival the one with the little round wooden top from Mexico that is currently the hot sauce of choice in many food establishments.  It is produced in and distributed from the Republic of California and I'm sure it also appeals to those who simply like the label or producer.  I, on the other hand, like the actual product and will be purchasing more when this bottle is drained.  It's not at the top of the Scoville scale, likely around 3000 to 5000, but that's just my estimation and I'm not a professional heat ranker.  The blend is very pleasant to the tongue and mouth, leaving no residual heat or flavor minutes after the last taste is consumed.  I don't get much smokiness as one would find in chipotle and I'm not overwhelmed by an acidy vinegar.  I get a balanced blend of assorted peppers that works and a consistency that is not runny or too thick.  For these reasons, I foresee thatGringo Bandito Hot Sauce, 5 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)will soon be seen on grocery shelves and restaurant tables in the near future and I'll be using it on my meals.",5.0

While I have no issues with Gluten, I do have several friends  that have eliminated gluten from their diet and so I was excited about trying out this mix as a way of making cookies that I could still share with them.I decided to follow the directions to the letter when making these.  The mixing was easy with my Kitchenaid mixer, but I had a bit of a problem rolling them out. Even between parchment paper, the were a bit on the sticky side.  I ended of adding a bit ofPamela's Products Artisan Flour Blendin between and that helped a lot and still kept it gluten free.  I did not use cookie cutters, but instead just used my pizza wheel to make diagonal cuts which gave me diamond shaped cookies and little to no wasted dough. I baked them for the minimum time, which gave them a slightly golden brown color.  The texture of the cookie was okay; still soft and not too dry or crumbly. As for the taste?  Too sweet!  And this was agreed upon by all that I shared them with.Overall this may be a good cookie substitute for those wanting gluten free, but it's too bad that Pamela's couldn't cut back on some of the unnecessary sweetness that it seems to have.",3.0

Of note is that the Cappucino single serving can is a couple ounces greater and double the calories.  My personal preference was the Caffe because I found it to taste fresher, less like a canned beverage, less sweet, and stronger in the coffee flavor.I gave away my Nespresso machine and currently do not have an electric espresso maker other than theDelonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric Moka Espresso Coffee Makerand prefer very strong coffee.  I still make it on the stovetop or prepare French drip coffee.  I sometimes use Splenda and froth steamed milk.  I used to roast green coffee beans but have also given away my roasters.  I grind beans prior to preparing coffee.  Just a little history for my frame of reference in writing this review.I'm not at all crazy about this coffee drink because my first impression was the sweetness, followed by the milky and very thin taste, and I experienced an aftertaste that I didn't care for.  I don't use much sugar, so that's perhaps why my taste buds were more sensitive, and as with all four tasters, although the ingredients listed Cocoa, we tasted very little in this beverage.  The coffee flavor was stronger than a simple cup of coffee, but the other flavors overwhelmed the coffee for me personally.  All three other tasters liked this flavor and said they would buy it if it's cost was around a dollar.  Two of the four tasters drink Chai regularly, always with lots of milk and sugar added.Our natural instinct is to shake a non-carbonated beverage, but there are strict instructions stating that the can is not to be shaken.  The can is nice to look at, smaller than a soda can and may cause problems in a beverage holder if you take these on a road trip.

One of the four packets of seasoning is blended with liquid and added to the rice. The rice is then simmered, rested and served. While the rice was fluffy, there was no discernible flavor other than salt. I don't usually fry rice but  coating with oil is most likely what inhibits sticking.I was disappointed in this product. Instead of flavor, I got salt. The overall texture of the rice was not noticeably different from what I usually prepare without this mix.

The overall consensus was that these were ""OK"" but generally most didn't really care too much for these. My opinion is as follows:PROS: Healthier than eating some of the other cookies on the market, has a decent taste when it's present.CONS: The cranberry was a little too chewy at times, which was kind of a little annoying. Even worse than that is occasionally the cookies were pretty bland tasting. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if it's just me, but these just didn't have a lot of flavor. (However, the blueberry ones I also got to try had a lot of flavor, so it's possible I just got an underseasoned batch.)These weren't horrible, but I don't think I'll be putting my own money towards this flavor anytime soon. When the cookies had a flavor I could taste, they were pretty good. It's just that these were sort of bland tasting that makes me not really like them as much. I might give them another chance somewhere down the line, but offhand I'm going to stick to the blueberry flavor. These were just ""OK"" & that's about all I can say for them.",3.0

I got the Blackberry Vanilla from Amazon and was so pleased with it I decided to try a several other flavors, including this Jasmine Passionfruit with Citrus.The smell and taste of the Jasmine Passionfruit is more tea-like rather than fruity.  I tend to have a bit of a sweet tooth  so I added a small small dollop ofOrganic Blue Agave, another natural product that enhanced the fruit flavor of this tea.  The taste is rather mild and perhaps will serve as a middle ground for those who prefer ""regular"" tea as opposed to fruit flavored.  This one is decaffeinated, a real plus for those who like to enjoy tea late in the evening or prefer decaffeinated beverages.INGREDIENTS:Decaffeinated green tea, jasmine tea, natural flavor, modified natural flavor, modified cornstarch, soy, lecithin.The tea drinker in my household, who is a fan of unsweetened green and black teas, didn't care much for this flavor.

Instead, it consists of a heavy mango base sweetened with honey.  The habanero is present, but only as a very mild background flavor, and the ginger is even further in the background, with almost no impact.And yet, all this sweetness stays very manageable, and that is why this sauce still succeeds at being a pleasant option.

Combined with cream and sugar, then no problem.I tried this coffee just wondering if I could really tell the difference between regular and low acid coffee.  There IS a difference! The flavor is quite good but doesn't end smoothly like oh, say, Folger's might, but this is a gourmet coffee and will carry a stronger punch than a commercial coffee like Folger's will.  I plan on trying a different roast too since my tastes are more towards a full-bodied coffee instead of the kind that tastes like it was made in Texas during the Wild West days!  This ends a bit rough, kinda like the Starbuck's Verona, not as smoothly as I would prefer.  I made it with bottled water, not tap, to get the full flavor and aroma, so keep that in mind when deciding on which flavor to choose.  I am going to continue to play with this flavor to see if I can get it to suit my tastes better.  If you try it and it's too strong, then I suggest you dump the pot onto your roses!  Makes them quite gorgeous, actually!This is a great product, particularly if you're looking for the low acid variety.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better low-acid coffee out there.

286,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B0025UK92C,"In my opinion, these are the best canned sardines available and since sardines are very healthy, they are always available in my pantry.  I sometimes mix them with mustard or hot sauce, occasionally just pour the can atop a salad and add some balsamic vinegar, use them instead of other fats on a baked potato, have a tasty sandwich on crusty bread with sliced onion, or just eat them out of the can.  I do recommend, however, being thoughtful of others if you take these to work because the smell isn't always well received.  Be sure to rinse the can and put it in something like a plastic bag or newspaper if using a community trash can.After my first taste of King Oscar Sardines in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, I stopped even considering others.  The tiny size makes them perfect to pop in the mouth and I have a little snap seal plastic container that fits the can perfectly if I eat only the top layer of the two.  I'm particular about my sardines after craving them while in Spain prior to knowing I was pregnant years ago.  I like these much better than the larger sardines of that time.  If you like your sardines in sauces, I would also recommend adding a condiment of your choice directly to the can if you're so inclined.  They are packed in Poland.",5.0

I continued to drink it, but after about a 1/4 of the cup I couldn't go on.

Having an option of eating a nutritionally balanced bar to consume as a meal replacement sounds like a good idea and I've tasted several of her meal options.  None has thrilled me, and their ingredient lists made the one from South Beach Diet Meal Bars in the Apple Cinnamon flavor seem minimal.

Out of the wrapper, I was immediately turned off by the coating, but I'm the kind of person who eats the birthday cake and leaves the icing.  If you like icing, you may love these bars.  Biting into it, my teeth met a very slight resistance and I visualized rice krispy treats with the texture.  It took me much thinking to get a cinnamon apple flavor processed by my brain.

1616,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00C7MGHVA,This package of K-Cups contains 22. Each K-Cup will brew 8-12 ounces of sweet tea depending on which setting your use on your Keurig machine. I like to use the 10 ounce setting to get a bigger cup but I wouldn't use the 12 ounce setting unless you like your tea a little bit weaker. You are supposed to fill a cup up with ice and brew one of these K-Cups into it. You will need a little bit bigger cup in order to accommodate all the ice. These K-Cups taste really good to me and they have the perfect amount of sweetness. As far as K-Cups go they are reasonably priced but compared to tea bags they are much more expensive. So I guess it just depends on how you look at it.

This was the first time that I had tried Black Tea but I think it's pretty good. I prefer the Iced Sweet Tea slightly but the Black Tea is good in it's own way. This tea brews nice and strong and you can easily brew a 12 ounce cup of tea without it being too weak. Unlike the sweet tea that's already sweetened this Black Tea isn't sweetened at all and doesn't contain any calories.

Let rest for five minutes, carefully cut open the bag, releasing the steam,then serve.I did not have chicken so I used pork chops instead. The prep was simple. The pork was moist. I prefer strong seasoning so I was not totally satisfied with this mild garlic blend. The cheese flavor was minimal and it was on the salty side. My other taste testers thought it was good. Clean up was a snap.The bag does infuse meat with flavor. The cooking method insures tender moist meat. And anything that minimizes mess garners major kudos. I would use this again but would probably make  my own spice mixture or rub. Recommended.",4.0

The powder dissolved surprisingly quickly and without much effort.  The color is beautiful and is not clear like standard green tea.  The texture is more akin to coffee made in a coffee press - a bit turbid and creamy.  It is a completely different experience.As a culinary grade matcha, I expected some bitterness, and it is there.

I gave the Plus option a try and my family of 4 decided that we like it a little better than the Classic option.  That shocked me because we aren't typically good about liking healthier options.  I'd rather eat smaller potions of something I love than bigger portions of something that I don't really like the taste of.Tonight we tried the Whole Grain options.  None of us really cared for it.  It was edible, we ate it, but we just weren't big on it.  We all said we wouldn't want it again.  The taste was nothing like the classic and the texture wasn't to our liking either.  It was a bit on the rough side rather than being smooth.  I normally don't my Whole Grain products.  I actually really like Whole Grain bread so I was kinda surprised that I didn't care for this.  I can say that I don't like Whole Wheat products and this seemed to fit into a category like that for me.  Just wasn't something I'd ever really choose to eat.Thin Spaghetti is what I choose most often so it was a good comparison for us.  It just didn't compare to the classic.Although I wish we would've liked it, we just didn't.  I can't say I'd recommend the Barilla Whole Grain line.

833,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B005Y10X9S,"I was surprised that, to my taste anyway, these bars are quite good. I liked them so much, in fact, that I ordered some more for myself after taste testing them through the Vine program. I like chocolate, but I don't always eat it (other than as low-sugar, dark chocolate) because it has a lot of calories. This bar satisfies chocolate cravings for me with relatively low calories, and it also has protein in it to keep blood sugar even.The ingredients of this bar aren't organic like theClif Bar, which is, or was, my favorite meal bar. However this bar is less condensed than the Clif bar. That means that for the same calories as in a Clif bar (which is 240 calories), you can eat two of these bars (if you subtract out the calories for the fiber it has, the net calories are only about 115). These bars also are much less expensive than Clif bars. They sell for around 50 cents each in most places, so two of them, the same weight as a single Clif bar, costs about 2/3 the price of a Clif bar, and there is a lot more volume to it, so you get to chew more. These bars also have almost twice the protein per weight as a Clif bar.Update 11/15/12: I got received the order I placed for these bars which I purchased myself. Interestingly, they were much more soft and chewy than the free sample I got from Vine, which is a texture I really like in a meal bar. Either the Vine samples were old and stale or they've improved the formula. Whatever the case may be, I like the new batch I got even more than the previous ones I tasted.",5.0

When I'm planning a meal, I need a whole box of pasta.

So when I had the chance, I decided to sample this so that I could decide if this would work for her.I made the chicken using the flour with the same normal measurements of salt and pepper, dredged the chicken pieces in the flour (I used boneless skinless breasts cut into chunks), then fried it on the stove top.I noticed I did have to turn the temperature up a bit extra to get these browned, but it could have been the oil I was using as well. After the chicken was done, I then used the drippings to make gravy. I simply added in some of the leftover flour mixture, fried it, and added milk. It did not seem to brown up as much, and it really didn't thicken as dramatically as flour would have, but it did make a decent gravy if a bit light in color.So my answer is an emphatic yes!

The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green. They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna. This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce. Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise. The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce. I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well. That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring. They lose a star on that account.",4.0

(And not all of us wants to carry around a partially opened packet of drink powder that always seems to want to empty out into the bottom of our purses.)Convenience-wise, this is pretty awesome. You can add as much or as little flavoring to this as you like, so if you like a very strong peach tea flavor, you're covered. Like it a little weaker? You can do that too. It's all liquid so it mixes together pretty awesomely as well. No clumps of powder in the bottle or cup that need to be shaken apart. (Which means no clumps of powder hitting your teeth if you're not willing to let the drink sit until the powder dissolves.)It's unfortunately not the best tasting stuff I've ever had. It's just a little too artificial tasting for me to really like it as much as I wanted to. I wasn't expecting miracles from this drink and I knew that it'd taste at least a little chemical-ish, but this is just a little off putting. It's good enough to where I'll drink it, but it's just not the best as far as peach tea goes.

I was not impressed with the amount of sugar (21 grams per serving)and had hoped for a more intense flavor. The label warns not to microwave or refrigerate and the expiration date on  my bottle was 11/14.It is easy to make your own version by processing raw or dry roasted almonds in the food processor and then adding some melted semi-sweet chocolate or organic chocolate chips, a little coconut or vegetable oil and a dash of salt. Process for a few more minutes and you have a version with less sugar that is geared to your taste. Store in the refrigerator but let come to room temperature to soften before use.This product would probably please most kids and it is convenient. I don't know that I would go out of my way for it, but it wasn't bad.",3.0

1788,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00DF05TC6,"Gary Poppins Gourmet Popcorn, Caramel, Cheddar, and Kettle is a mix of all three flavors in the same bag.  That worried me at first, but the cheddar and caramel actually go well together and the kettle is irrelevant.First, the best.  The caramel popcorn tastes very good, with a thin and slightly crunchy coating of caramel on the outside with distinct real dairy flavors.  This is better than most any packaged caramel popcorn I have had.The cheddar popcorn is very salty and has that same taste and artificial color as generic macaroni and cheese powder or puffed cheese snacks and it leaves the fingers orange.  It does have a pleasant cheese flavor but it is very salty.  These kernels are very soft and have a very unpleasant texture when bitten, like a styrofoam peanut.  Oh, and did I mention that it is very salty?The plain kettle corn is much scarcer in the bag than the other two.  It picks up a little of the cheese powder and almost every time I looked in the bag to pull one out, it turned out to be caramel instead.  With the strong caramel and cheddar flavors competing for attention on the tongue, it is not very distinguishable except by texture.  Fortunately, it is not as soft as the cheddar flavor but it doesn't have the crunch of the caramel flavor.  It is definitely not stale but not particularly fresh-tasting or -textured, either.The size of the popcorn left a bit to be desired and there were several very hard pieces and even a couple of burnt ones.  The bag didn't appear to have been mishandled but the package was about one third crumbs, many of which were completely coated with cheddar or caramel, so I guess I literally got the bottom of the barrel.  The &#34;best by&#34; date on the bag I received is 030314, about three months from now.In summary, the cheddar popcorn is too soft and too salty and there is no point to including the kettle corn, which just picks up the other flavors and is lost to the tastebuds.

It might pay you in the long run to see what your local water's ph. is. Ours is ph. 8. I'm not sure if that little bit in a ph. difference would matter.

Half the bag is a more likely serving and that would make them not very healthy as far as fat content.  I also don't believe the sodium content is accurate simply because of how salty they are.

The popcorn itself doesn't seem fresh;  it's not chewy but it is quite dry and doesn't have much corn flavor at all. It is tastier than a stale box of Cracker Jack with rancid peanuts but not particularly appealing except to satisfy a sugar and cinnamon craving.There are nominally six servings at one oz. and 140 calories each but realistically, it is three servings to the bag at two oz. and 280 calories each.The ingredient list is horrific:  Corn syrup, sugar, then corn, then downhill from there through several more types of sugar, oil, margarine, and miscellaneous bits of this and that all the way down to peanut flour.  When I make something similar from scratch, the ingredients are corn, oil (for popping only), corn syrup, sugar, butter, vanilla, and salt.  Cinnamon and a sprinkling of brown sugar would also be needed for this particular flavor.The manufacturer, Con Agra, tries to make this candy-coated corn seem healthy by stating that it has half the fat of regular potato chips.

The score: 0 for 10.  I NEVER got a decent cup of coffee from them.

Pale, caramel-colored water.

935,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B007JFXWRC,"With fall coming, I was in the mood for a new tea. I was a little apprehensive over the addition of vanilla to the blackberry, I must admit, since vanilla is one of those flavors that can so often make or break a tea. If it's too strong, the tea becomes undrinkable for me and if it's too light then it ruins the whole purpose of adding vanilla in the first place.The vanilla taste of this is more of a hint than a strong flavor, which is how I prefer it. It does a lot to even out the tartness of the blackberry, which is something that I both like and regret. Sometimes you just want a nice tart tea, although I'll probably get more mileage out of this since it's such a mellow drink. I emphasize mellow, as this isn't a very intense beverage. If you're looking for something with an overwhelmingly strong flavor then you'll probably want to move on to some of the other flavors out there. However, if you want something that would be good to drink before bedtime then this would be the thing since it won't shock your tastebuds into full alert and it's caffeine free, which means that it won't keep you up.One of the features on the box is the pyramid tea bag shape, which I can verify is a great tea bag shape. It allows the tea bits to swirl around and brew up faster. I've used various brands that have this design and they tend to brew faster and with less ""squeezing"" of the tea bag to get the tea out. It's also a prettier tea bag, although that probably won't factor in much with most buyers. The only thing I'd warn about is that once in a blue moon the tea bag will rip if you yank the string too hard when removing it from around the teabag. In almost every case I've had the tea bag be perfectly fine, but if you're exceptionally clumsy and/or strong then you'll want to be a little more delicate.",4.0

1451,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00AV5JCDU,"Despite trying to cut down on pre-packaged K-cups, I tend to always go for these whenever they come up in Vine. This has to be one of the better ones I've tried so far, although I'll admit that I've had better cinnamon ground coffee.The good thing is that the cinnamon taste here is not overwhelming. I was really worried that I'd get nothing but this overwhelming cinnamon taste in my mouth, as some flavored coffees tend to go overboard on whatever they flavor the grounds with- especially with K-cups. This is pretty subtly flavored and while you can pick it out, it's not the strongest flavor out there. If you like a lot of milk in your coffee or a lot of powdered creamer, it'll become a little harder to pick out than it would with say, the cinnamon flavored Dunkin' Donuts coffee or the Donut House cinnamon roll. This was both one of my best and least favorite aspects of the coffee and probably what some of you guys will either love or hate. Personally I really enjoyed it, but I can already see some disliking that the cinnamon flavor here isn't as strong as they'd like.Now when it comes to just the basic coffee flavor, this is a very light roast. This isn't something I'd recommend for people who want a little more boldness and kick to your morning joe, which is why I'd probably recommend that you try out the Dunkin Donuts variety if you want something with a bit more kick to it. However if you want something that's on the mild and sedate side, this is definitely something to check out. If I saw this in the store I'd be likely to buy it with my own money in the future, although I admit that I'd probably go for Donut House or Dunkin Donuts first. That's probably why I'm only giving this three stars instead of four. I almost gave it that extra star because I genuinely would purchase this in the future if I see it, but at the same time I can't deny that I'm a bigger fan of Donut House. However if you want something on the more mild side, you'd probably prefer this to my usual brand.",3.0

I really wanted to try this sauce and enhance the flavor of the meat but instead, it overwhelmed the beef flavor more than what we expected.  For hubby, this was more like A1 sauce on a piece of steak.  He says that if the steak is good, it doesn't need anything but salt and pepper but if it needs some help, then he would add A1 sauce.  He was a bit disappointed to have a good piece of chuck roast with something that tasted like A1 sauce on top.  I didn't really mind it much, I should've added a few things like more mushrooms, onions, and definitely some veggies.  For the price, I probably won't buy it often but I'd be willing to give it another try.  Hubby says that it could work with hamburger patties like a sauce on top, we'll see.If you like A1 sauce on your steak, you might like this sauce on your roast.

I've looked at these before, but anyone who loves fish in cans knows that trying out new brands can be... dangerous. Either the meat is subpar, the stuff tastes weird, or the fish itself can be rotted.Upon opening the can, I was very surprised at how small the fish were. As the synopsis states, they're dainty. You get about what you'd get in a can with the bigger variety, so no worries about losing out on meat. The smaller size made the sardines easier to remove from the can, which helps when you're opening up the can for a small meal or a snack.The fish weren't overwhelmingly spicy, but you could tell that they'd been soaking in oil with jalapenos. I didn't really eat the jalapenos, as I wasn't overly fond of the texture. This isn't to mean that the jalapenos were bad, I just like mine to be more crunchy. I've lived with people who grew them and served them up fresh, so I've been ruined forever on that aspect.All in all, I'll purchase these in the future and try out the other varieties.

546,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B004E4EBMG,"I received my bottle of Mio Mango Peach flavoring free from the Amazon Vine Program, in exchange for writing a review.I have a girlfriend who loves Mio and had been encouraging me to try it.  I think the flavor she likes is sweet tea.  So when I saw it offered on the Vine website, I jumped at it.  I drink a gallon of water every day, and sometimes it gets a little monotonous.  What would be nicer than a no-calorie peach/mango flavoring to add to the water, right?I'm sorry to say that I won't be buying Mio in the future.  I had to add 3 or 4 squirts to a glass of water to get any recognizable mango or peach flavoring.  And then it had a very strong saccharine-type aftertaste, and an almost perfume-y smell.  The Mio website claims that it uses sucralose and not saccharine, but whatever it was I didn't like it. Unfortunately, sucralose can also cause diarrhea and gas if enough is ingested.A look at the ingredients on the bottle confirmed my suspicions that this was just another way to ingest unhealthy ingredients masked as ""natural"".  Propylene glycol - a type of mineral oil, can cause allergic skin reactions.  Yellow #5, Blue #1, and/or Red #40 - these have been linked to ADHD, hyperactivity in children, and lymphoma. Acesulfame Potassium, an artificial sweetener, aggravates hypoglycemia, and has been linked to breast and lung tumors. That's quite a chemical cocktail we're adding to our water!It does come in a cute little bottle that would go well in a purse or backpack.  And if you are counting carbs or calories, or are diabetic, these drops could be a nice way to flavor plain old water.But for me, I'll just continue to add a squirt of lemon or lime juice to my water.

I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  However, unlike the watermelon flavor, I found this variety vibrant and delicious.

419,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,B003EXVM66,I made some lasagna today and it was the first time I've used Oven Ready/No Boil noodles.  I thought they turned out pretty good.  They tasted good and they were cooked well for the most part.The problem that I ran into was the sizing of the noodles.  Typically when I boil lasagna noodles I can stack them up in 3 rows in a 13x9 casserole dish.  These noodles aren't as long as normal noodles and they're wider than normal noodles.  I thought I could still line them up in 3 rows but turned in the opposite direction than I normally due.  There were quite a bit of gaps in my dish and I quickly learned that it was going to be stacked too high so I did some adjusting.  I ended up getting 4 noodles in each layer by turning them back in the normal direction but I then had to overlap the ends a little bit.  By the time I got to the top I had a bit that hung a bit too far over the end and since there was still a gap along the sides the edges and ends of my noodles got a bit too crispy and well done.  I'm not sure what the solution would be but I think the noodles would be better if they were sized to fit into a 13x9 like the normal boil lasagna noodles are.Aside from those burnt edges that I ended up with I made the best lasagna that I've ever made.

1806,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B00DGPCI56,"These almonds are dusted with cocoa powder and sugar, but they are not sweet. Also, rather than dry roasting them, they are roasted with oil, which unnecessarily raises the calorie count. Some consumers may not like the fact that the oil chosen might be canola oil (the ingredients do not spell out precisely which type of oil is used).My biggest problem with these almonds is that many of the ingredients are far from healthy, even though this is clearly marketed as a healthy snack. It is certainly true that raw or dry-roasted almonds are excellent for the health, and dark chocolate is great, too. But unfortunately, most of the rest of the ingredients are questionable at best. I have provided information on all the non-obvious and unhealthy ingredients below.In short, think there are much better ways to add almonds and dark chocolate to one's diet than this product. I tried a sample package through Vine, and I will not be purchasing this for myself in the future.Ingredients: Roasted almonds (almonds, peanut and/or canola oil), sugar, water, cocoa processed with alkali, less than 2% of peanut oil, dextrose, soy lecithin, artificial flavors, silicone dioxide, propylene glycol.Warning: contains tree nuts (almonds), soy, possibly peanuts.Artificial Flavor: The definition of artificial flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""Any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is *not* derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. "" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Even more so than for a ""natural"" flavor, because the process by which it is derived is unexplained, there is no way for the consumer to decide how safe the artificial flavor is.Dextrose: Like fructose and glucose, dextrose is what is known as a ""simple"" sugar, a monosaccharide. It can be combined to form more complex sugars, such as the disaccharide known as sucrose, or table sugar. Dextrose is actually a form of glucose, but since glucose has a bad association for consumers with diabetes (it is the ""blood sugar"" that diabetics measure the levels of), the food industry almost never uses that term. Like all carbohydrates, it has approximately 4 calories per gram. Dextrose occurs naturally in fruit and honey. Commercially produced dextrose is made from cornstarch.Lecithin or Lecithin Phospholipid: Lecithins are prepared by extracting and purifying phospholipids from products such as eggs, soybeans, sunflower and canola seeds--in the case of this product, it is from soybeans. In food products and cosmetics, lecithin is used as an emulsifier. At issue is how exactly it is derived. Lecithin is a fatty substance that is extracted either chemically or mechanically. Certainly some small businesses around the world exist which employ non-toxic, cold-press methods of extraction, but big factories do not. They create lecithin by means of highly toxic, carcinogenic chemicals such benzene and hexane. The food and cosmetic industry are not required to report on their labels how the lecithin they use is extracted, so we have no reliable way of knowing how safe it is.Propylene Glycol AKA 1,2-propanediol: There are many different glycols, which are commonly used in brake fluids, plasticizers, resins, polyurethane, polyester, chemical solvents, and insect repellents. This particular glycol, propylene glycol, has physical properties similar to ethylene glycol, perhaps the most highly toxic glycol and the first one ever devised in a lab in 1860. Unfortunately, consumers are blithely assured by manufacturers who use it extensively in foods, cosmetics, and oral hygiene products as a solvent, preservative, and humectant (moisture-retaining) agent that among all other glycols, this one is not toxic. In contradiction to that assertion, propylene glycol is manufactured in large amounts from propylene oxide, a known human carcinogen. It is sometimes substituted for ethylene glycol in antifreeze because, unlike ethylene glycol, it will not immediately kill any child who accidentally ingests it, but it is still not safe to ingest in large quantities. It is not particularly safe when absorbed through the skin either. Over a long period of time, it presents a risk for causing kidney damage and liver abnormalities.Silicone dioxide: This ingredient is known as silica, silicon and silicone. Silicone dioxide is a common food additive used primarily in powdered foods to make them flow better without caking. Silicone dioxide is also an important nutrient in the diet and can be taken as a supplement (for more information on supplemental silica, see my review here on Amazon: http://amzn.to/12QTKNk). Silica improves the health of bones, nails, skin and hair, and it may also help prevent arthritis and osteoporosis and Alzheimer's. It is also beneficial to the arteries and helps the body maintain a healthy level of blood pressure. Research indicates it helps the skin form collagen, the lowered production of which contributes to wrinkling of the skin as we age. Silica is found naturally in grains such as oats and barley, in nuts, legumes, fruits, root vegetables and green leafy vegetables.",2.0

Making them was as simple as could be - just add butter and an egg to the mix, form a ball, roll it out, cut and bake. The package directions were very accurate as to baking time.The overall taste was pretty good. It was not as good as a ""regular"" sugar cookie, but very palatable. I made them just as-is, but if I were to make them again, I'd probably add something such as chocolate chips to make them a bit more interesting.The only downside is the texture. The cookies are on the crumbly side and don't hold together as well as a regular sugar cookie. It's not a major problem, but I did find it noticeable. Still, if you need to limit or eliminate gluten from your diet it's a small price to pay for otherwise pretty tasty cookies.",4.0

One bottle lasts a long time since it makes 24 servings.Cons: The packaging could be better. It's hard to get it to squeeze properly - either nothing comes out, or you get a gush all at once. Although the bottle is designed to be stood cap-down, it leaks a small amount when positioned in that manner. It needs to be refrigerated after opening.Taste: It's just OK. It doesn't have much of a ""fake sugar"" aftertaste, but it also doesn't have much of a fruit taste either.

What I like about Mio is that I can take it with me on the road and turn any water into flavored water. I have never liked to drink plain tap water but Mio can change that. Each bottle is said to last 24 servings but it will change depending on your personal taste. One serving is a brief squirt or  teaspoon of Mio.  It's doesn't have any calories or carbs which is important to me because I am trying watch my weight. I have tried other flavors that were better but I don't like the sweet tea flavor at all. It tastes exactly like what it is fake tea. It hardly resembles the taste of tea at all with all in my opinion. I could hardly finish a couple glasses of it and would not get it again. I let my wife try it and she liked it so it will obviously depend on your individual taste. The cost seems high for such a small bottle but it will flavor 192 oz. of water.,2.0

Whenever you add ginger to something and heat it up, ginger is going to be something that you can easily taste. I just wasn't expecting it to be this gingery.This smelled good when I first mixed it (although it looked like brown water), but it's the taste that killed me. This was pretty spicy and the ginger taste was incredibly strong. I couldn't taste the lemon in this at all, the ginger taste was so overwhelmingly strong. The comparisons of this to a medicine are pretty apt. It reminds me of some of the cold medicines that I'll add to hot water whenever I get a runny nose. Not exactly a taste that I'm eager to drink on a regular basis.I drank a little of it, but I ended up having to dump it out. Even when considering that ginger is a miraculous plant, I still wouldn't buy this even as an occasional pick me up. I can see drinking it for a cold since it'd definitely clean your sinuses out, but it's just too strong of a drink for me. I'd much rather go for some fresher ginger than this. I'm not sure that I'd drink this to help with nausea either, to be honest. (Ginger is AWESOME for upset tummies.)

My mom said that she felt that it had a little fishiness to it, but not enough to where it'd really deter either of us.I made my popcorn on the stove top with oil and I highly recommend doing this when it comes to using any of this brand's toppings. The oil makes it easier for the topping to stick, although it's better if you put the popcorn in a plastic baggie and shake it up before each time you ate it, just because it'll spread the topping around easier.The flavor here isn't bad, but I don't know that I'll buy this with my own money in the future.

130,A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,B0014WYXQK,"First there were two cases of IZZE: one each of Apple and Pomegranate.  I quickly cleaned out half of my refrigerator to make room for the 48 cans of IZZE.  Then a case of IZZE Clementine arrived. Finally, I received the sought-after Blackberry. The IZZEs were multiplying out of control.  The two new ones took up the rest of my refrigerator. There was no room for anything but IZZE. At my house, it has become all IZZE all the time.To the credit of IZZE, the ingredients of all their products are posted on the IZZE web site. The IZZEs have all natural ingredients, although the labeling indicates that the citrus varieties. e.g. Clementine and Grapefruit, contain Gum Arabic and Ester Gum. According to sources on the web, Gum Arabic is a purified natural vegetable gum obtained from the acacia tree that is used as a stabilizer/emulsifier.  Ester Gum is purified natural rosin from pine trees.  I suppose trees are natural.An interesting fact about the IZZEs is that for every type of IZZE, the fruit named on the front of the can does not correspond to the first-listed ingredient. Here is the IZZE code decoded: for Apple the main ingredient is White Grape, for Pomegranate it is Apple, for Clementine it is White Grape, for Grapefruit it is White Grape and for Blackberry it is White Grape.There is no caffeine in IZZE. The IZZE web site says that IZZE employees ride bikes to the local coffee shop. So you cannot live on IZZE alone! All of the IZZEs are fortified with vitamins, e.g., Vitamin B6, C, and Niacin. I am sure that the IZZE people anticipated the need for vitamins for people surviving on a diet consisting of IZZE and coffee.All of the IZZE flavors have their own character.  Some are weaker, others stronger.  In order of weak to strong for the four that I tried, I would arrange them as Apple, Clementine, Blackberry, and Pomegranate.  I prefer the more subtle flavors of Apple and Clementine. However, when I brought an assortment to a gathering of friends, all of the Pomegranate cans disappeared while the Apples remained untouched.  It is a matter of personal taste. People who are used to soda, which includes most people,  prefer the stronger Blackberry and Pomegranate. Juice people may like Apple or Clementine better. I give the Clementine 5 stars, the others 4 stars. All of the flavors are good. Which one you prefer is up to you.",5.0

Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.3.4/5",3.0

I like things on the al dente side, almost to the point of chewy.The olive oil went into the pan and then the mix.  A friend suggested doing this and I think it does enhance not only the texture, but also the flavor.  I added the requisite water and instead of covering and boiling, I stir fried it.  Mind you, many people won't like it this way so just take it as a suggestion.  The ""regular"" cooking instructions are on the box.  I added halved grape tomatoes (I did this with the Tuscan Medley as well) and mixed them in for added color and a bit of zest.The taste was excellent, but it did have a bit more salt in the recipe than I'd like.  I'm slowly making my way through a selection of Side Mates and definitely liked the taste of this one.

In fact if I was going on vacation I'd take these packets of iced tea mix with me. One packet works well in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water but it tastes even better stirred into a glass of water with ice.

This contains honey granules (made from honey and sugar), sucralose and maltodextrin. This also contains green tea powder, hibiscus extract and natural flavor (mango and pineapple). If you made this tea with only 8 ounces of water as it suggests then this tea would be very sweet. It needs about double that amount of water to taste normal.

Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green.  They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna.  This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce.  Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise.  The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce.  I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions.

1343,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B00A4ASPVC,"I didn't use the stovetop or microwave to prepare the ""Thai Curry"" rice and pasta blend, but rather prepared it in myBlack & Decker 3-cup Rice Cooker.  Similar to the microwave method, I added 2 1/4 cups of water to the mix.  The mixture was close to the top of the pan, but came out perfectly.  I don't generally add anything to my rice except veggies so I could definitely enjoy the curry flavor this side had to offer.  I didn't care much for the Creamy Chipotle, but loved this one. This is just the type of side dish, as are all the Knorr sides, that you can add any number of things to.  If I make this one again, I'll definitely add some veggies or other ingredients to round it out to make it more of a ""meal"" than a side.There really wasn't anything in the ingredients that my dietician would frown at, however it may contain egg and sulfites which may be problematic for some people.  For one thing there are no artificial colors in here.  The rice is colored by turmeric as opposed to artificial coloring, something I appreciate.  The only thing that was slightly off was the high sodium content, something those on a low sodium diet might want to take note of and take a pass.  I do like Knorr products and have used many of them in the past, especially to liven up a main dish.  For many, this ""side"" could turn into one easily.

It's a strong fruity flavor with less chemical aftertaste then the other flavors.It's caffeine free and sugar free, which makes it a good option for people who dislike plain water. It adds sweetness and flavor. The size of the bottle makes it easy to carry, and the fact it's so concentrated means it can be added easily to bottled waters.I'll stick to drinking herbal tea for the most part for flavor and hydration, but I do appreciate the convenience this offers and the flexibility of determining how much flavor and sweetness you want.",4.0

Having drunk green tea regularly for years because of its antioxidant properties (as well as taken vitamin supplements and eaten raw vegetables of the cabbage family for the same purpose), I was quite interested in the Matcha as well. When I received the Matcha I began mixing in a teaspoon with my morning green tea. To begin with, it definitely improved the flavor. Not that the flavor of my green tea was bad, but this gave it a little bit of extra zest and made it more pleasant to the taste. I haven't had a chance to use it in smoothies or baking, which are other suggested ways of using it, but I plan to do this as well. Other listed benefits are improved skin and hair health and improved memory functioning. Here it's a little too early to tell, since I've been taking other supplements for both these purposes.

1908,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00EDHW7F2,I recently tried the Caza Trail Columbian Blend Fair Trade Coffee. I like a wide variety of coffee but Columbian coffee is typically one of my favorite options. I have tried Caza Trail coffee before in several different varieties and I have always liked it. This Columbian Blend coffee is good as well. It has a nice flavor and is really smooth. It almost tastes like a breakfast blend or doughnut shop coffee. I think it has a slightly milder flavor than most good Columbian coffee. It&#8217;s a good coffee for first thing in the morning with toast or breakfast. I have also used it to make caf&eacute; mocha&#8217;s and with other flavored creamers and it tasted good as well. This coffee is fair trade certified so you know it was produced under honest and fair working conditions. This box comes in a package of 52 so they will last a while and the K-Cups are the regular and typical type so they are quick and easy to use. If you like a rich and medium roast coffee that is good for everything then this coffee might be a good option for you.,4.0

It does have a very faint soft mineral taste on the tongue which might not even be noticed under ordinary circumstances.It comes in a large 1.5 liter bottle that is surprisingly easy to grip and pour and I really like the fact that it is filtered and treated with UV light.

They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce.

After drinking this, I can honestly say that I'm underwhelmed.Taste-wise, this isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's pretty much your run of the mill canned expresso beverage and while I've had worse, there wasn't that much to make it stand out. As others have said, the cocoa flavor just isn't there. That wouldn't actually be something I'd speak out against, except that the drink does claim that it's in there and there will be people who will be expecting to actually taste cocoa. It's not here, or if it is then it's so faint that you wouldn't be able to taste it unless you're really, really looking for it.Now the good thing about this is that it isn't overly sweet. I do like sweet coffee/expresso beverages, but a lot of times the bottled or canned beverages will be just overly saturated with it. This drink isn't, which was actually a nice change of pace and something that I know some of you will appreciate. Another thing that some might like is that it's only 100 calories for the full can, which was nice. It's still 19 carbs, but it's good to have a low calorie option for those of us that are trying to avoid the coffee drinks that have a bajillion calories.Overall, this just didn't stand out that much to me. It's good enough that I'd probably buy it if I was at the store, wanted a cold coffee/expresso drink, but didn't want anything sweet.

1345,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00A4ASPVC,"Knorr Rice Sides in Thai Curry flavor is actually a blend of rice and vermicelli.  It has a mild yellow curry seasoning but it doesn't strike me as particularly a Thai curry;  it's more of a generic curry as from those jars at the supermarket rather than as made from the Thai curry pastes.  I don't notice much flavor from the sesame oil or the coconut, just yellow curry powder and a sweet flavor that is not subtle enough and certainly not from palm sugar.I added some carrot and frozen peas and frozen shrimp to make a complete meal but didn't add any other seasonings, only water and olive oil, so as not to overpower the shrimp.Overall, it's fine for a quick and very easy meal in a dorm room or when hiking, tasty enough though not authentic, but a little too generic and sweet for regular use at home with a full kitchen available.I suppose it would be a treat with limited cooking facilities, with some pepper flakes and powdered coconut milk added, especially compared to endless pouches of oatmeal, ramen, creamy pasta, and mashed potatoes. However, I'll stick to using Mae Ploy curry paste, Chaokoh coconut milk, and fermented soy paste when I crave curry at home.It would be nice if Lipton used whole-grain rice and pasta in this line.Rating is three stars for regular use and five stars for away from home for an average of four stars.",4.0
44,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B000F3V880,"I've been drinking ginger tea with honey, lemon and a bit of cayenne pepper to soothe my sore throat for a few days now.  Today, I have been given a combination of flavors which supplant that tea  in the form of Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce.  I'm a big fan of their Razzpotle sauce and LOVE heat, mango and/or ginger, so this sauce had my name written all over it.  It exceeded my expectations, I'm thrilled to report.  I first tried it simply out of the bottle on a spoon with a few Williamsburg peanuts while I made dinner.  I found that the combination of flavors actually stimulated my appetite, so I began working my way through the fridge.  Now I mentioned that I've had a sore throat, so I wasn't feeling too creative.  I prepared a Morningstar corn dog in the toaster oven and enjoyed it dipped in this thick sauce.  Mango pulp delivers not only rich flavor but a thick consistency which works perfectly in this dipping sauce.  The habanero peppers give it a little kick right up front but don't linger for me or burn any areas of my mouth at all because of the sugar and honey.  The ginger blends with mango and if I could change anything in the recipe of this sauce, I'd add more ginger for the earthy heat it delivers and entirely remove the sugar.  I then remembered a cheese log a la Martha Stewart's recipe was living in my cheese bin, so I poured a little sauce on the pistachio encrusted cheese and it was an improvement to an otherwise unremarkable creamy cheese concoction.  Cha-ching, another winner -- add a piece of fruit, a salad and it's a simple lunch for tomorrow.  While brewing another cup of tea, I put a dollop inside the teacup and it was better than adding the honey and lemon.  Although it contains habanero, it wasn't hot enough, so I still added the cayenne.  Finally, I churned a glass of fresh carrot juice with a piece of fresh ginger and half apple, then added a little bit of the sauce.  Who would have thought that the sweet heat would heighten the flavor of this fresh juice?  I did and I sure am glad I used it with abandon.  Tomorrow is another day, so if I'm feeling better and have the energy to actually cook, I'm going to mix the sauce with a little soy sauce, garlic and coconut, rub it on a black cod steak and grill it for dinner, maybe with a nice risotto.  The Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is a new staple in my household and I'm certain to share it with my closest personal friends.",5.0

985,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B007N04AF6,"Here is my bottom line, and you can skip my analysis if that sort of thing doesn't interest you: I enjoyed the taste of this product (which I score 4 stars), but this product is expensive and not as healthy as it seems on the surface. As a result, I would prefer to make my own oatmeal usingQuaker Old-Fashioned Oatsand my own safe flavorings, such as vanilla, cinnamon, and allspice. I will also use my own dried cherries and nuts and sweeten it with healthy, no-caloriesteviarather than the sugar this product employs.Now for my analysis of the product:As stated above, this product tastes good, and it is definitely convenient. The process of making it is like that of a ramen-noodle soup. You remove the lid, peel off the protective paper cover, add about 1 cup of boiling water (which takes around one minute to heat in the microwave), put the lid back on, and let it sit three minutes. Voila! Four-minute, ""instant"" oatmeal.The issue for most consumers, though, isn't just taste and convenience. There is also the question of health and cost. Like most of Quaker's oat-based products, this one is being marketed as a ""health food"" by the manufacturer, which naturally leads to the question: Exactly how healthy is it? This product comes in single-serving, plastic containers which inevitably raises the price on behalf of providing convenience. In short, is it actually healthier, cheaper, and not much more time consuming to make one's own fruit-and-nut oatmeal than to use this product?One of the worst health concerns for this product is that you pour hot water into a plastic container, which will inevitably cause chemicals from that plastic to leach into the food. This is never a good thing.The ingredients of this product vary in how healthy they are. Below is a list of the ingredients with comments on each one:(1) Whole grain rolled oats: Whole grains are considered healthy by most health experts, other than Dr. Joseph Mercola. They contain vitamins, minerals and fiber, and they don't usually cause any health issues unless you have an allergy to gluten. Oats don't have gluten if (and only if) they have not been stored with wheat, barley or rye and cross-contaminated with gluten. It is doubtful if regular Quaker oats aregluten free, because that kind of thing is strongly advertised and costs extra. If you are not allergic to gluten, you can obtain Quaker rolled oats in any grocery store and safely use them.(2) Dried, sweetened cherries, sweetened with sugar: Cherries are quite healthy; sugar is not. However, sugar is a much better choice than high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) found in most pre-sweetened, packaged foods. If you wanted to make your own fruit-nut oatmeal with cherries, admittedly, dried cherries aren't easy to find in most grocery stores, and when you can find them, they are expensive.Dried cherriesare sold here on Amazon, and they are delicious. In a one-cup serving of oatmeal, you wouldn't need more than a tablespoon at most, which would cost pennies. You could also avoid sugar entirely and use a natural sweetener likestevia, which works really well in hot cereal.(3) Multi grain blend consisting of whole-grain rolled oats, rolled barley, whole grain rolled rye: Whole grains again, are fairly healthy, if you aren't allergic to gluten, which is in wheat, barley and rye. If you wanted to replicate these grains to make your own cereal, it is easy to find Quaker rolled oats in your grocery store, but rolled barley and rolled rye would be a little more problematic. Fortunately, most people wouldn't miss them.(4) Brown sugar: This is no more healthy than white sugar though, like white sugar, it is less unhealthy than HFCS. If you made your own fruit-nut oatmeal, you could either use brown sugar that is easily obtained at your local grocery store, or avoid sugar entirely and use stevia.(5 & 6) Pistachios and almonds: Nuts are a healthy source of fat, protein and fiber. Most grocery stores sell almonds and pistachios, and you could easily add some to your own home-made oatmeal. Like dried cherries, nuts are rather expensive, but you wouldn't need very many for a single serving.(7) Nonfat dry milk: This is a relatively healthy source of protein, provided you are not lactose intolerant. If you made your own fruit-nut oatmeal, you could just use regular milk--or if you are lactose intolerant, you could use a milk substitute, such as soy or almond milk.(8) Whole grain rolled wheat: More whole grain--see discussion above. This would be harder to substitute if you wanted to make your own version of this product but, again, most people wouldn't miss it.(9) Natural flavor: This ingredient is a real problem for those concerned about health. Whenever a food manufacturer uses flavoring other than what exists in the ingredients themselves, particularly the two main ingredients that are part of the name of the product--in this case ""cherry"" and ""pistachio""--it's a strong indicator that they are employing those flavors to cut down on manufacturing costs by reducing the amount of those ingredients in the product.Natural flavor is also a problem because it is impossible for the consumer to find out exactly what it actually consists of. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real, edible substance, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained, therefore it is impossible to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring truly is.If you made your own fruit-nut oatmeal, you could expand on the flavor provided by dried cherries and nuts by using vanilla and/or healthy spices that enhance sweetness, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cloves.Another issue for consumers is this: other than product diversification for Quaker as a means to more sales, why should a consumer who has previously enjoyed the convenience of Quaker'sinstant oatmeal packets, switch to this product? The instant oatmeal packet's contents are poured into a container of your choice (not heated up in plastic). They take 90 seconds to be ready to eat after you pour on hot water, so they are faster than this product to prepare, though admittedly only by 90 seconds. The nutritional content is similar for both products, though I will admit the taste for this product may be a bit better, and the crunchy ""mouth feel"" is a bit better, too.In terms of the nutritional content, the calories per gram are similar in this product and the instant oatmeal packets. An instant oatmeal packet is 160 calories per 43-gram serving, or 3.72 calories per gram. It has 3 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, and 9 grams of sugar. That's less than 1% fiber, less than 1% fat, 10% protein, and 21% sugar. In comparison, Real Medleys has 290 calories per 73-gram serving. Note that this serving is the same volume, about 1 cup, but it is ""denser,"" that is, it weighs more and what is in it has more calories (5.5 grams more of fat and 5% more sugar), though by weight, it is only slightly more calories per gram, 4.0 vs 3.72. It has 5 grams of fiber, 9 grams of protein, 8 grams of fat (from pistachios and almonds), and 19 grams of sugar. That's less than 1% fiber, less than 1% fat, 12% protein, and 26% sugar. Real Medleys does have a bit higher percentage of protein, which is good. The higher percentage of sugar is not so good. It is possible the extra sugar is natural fructose from the cherries, of course. And given that cherries are the second ingredient listed on the ingredient list, which are ranked by volume of that ingredient in the product, most to last, that is possible.",3.0

13,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B000BIZT3E,"Be careful to introduce this soy formula gradually.  If a baby is put on it exclusively, perhaps in an effort to avoid colic-related pain, the result will likely be painful constipation.  Soy-based formula is highly identified with constipation, although some children don't have a better choice.The formulas that break milk down to a level for a baby's tummy to process it are all significantly more expensive.  This all comes down to a matter of money, and it is stressful for parents that can't afford the premium offered by each major brand.Therefore, go easy and slowly as a percentage of the formula your baby eats and eventually see if baby can consume this soy formula without the constipation.  It's worth a try.  Constipated babies will cry with all their might though.",3.0

When the tea is brewed, it takes on the dark color of the Assam.  At first sip, I found the dominant taste to be that of the Assam Tea. Then the spices asserted their own flavors.

If I made these again I'd add in a little honey to make them a bit sweeter. Also they don't rise like regular biscuits so they are smaller and flatter. You can also make scones with this mix. There are instructions for herb biscuits and cheese biscuits. You can also make shortcake. To make the biscuits I had to cut in butter first and I'd recommend you use frozen butter that you have cut up with a serrated steak knife. It gets the butter small enough to cut in easily.

It has only 14 ounces of soup compared to 19 ounces in most canned soups, such a similar flavor/style of soup,Progresso Traditional Soup, Southwestern-Style Chicken, and where Progresso runs around $2.00-$2.50/can, this sells currently for $3.57/pouch.Below is a list of ingredients and instructions from the package, and my comment on the one questionable ingredient below that.Ingredients: Water, Pulled Chicken Meat (Chicken Meat, Water, Salt, Modified Food Starch, Isolated Soy Protein, Chicken Flavor [Contains Chicken Stock, Chicken {Dried}, Chicken Fat], Natural Flavoring), Black Beans, Sweet Corn, Organic Quinoa, Diced Tomatoes in Tomato Juice, Green Bell Peppers, Pinto Beans, Contains Less than 2% of: Roasted Poblano Chilies, Tomato Paste, Potato Starch, Tequila, Onions (Dried), Lime Juice, Salt, Sugar, Cilantro, Yeast Extract, Paprika, Spices, Garlic (Dried), Spice Extractives and Oleoresin of Paprika, Natural Flavors.Microwave Directions: Microwave ovens vary. Time given is approximate. Uneven microwave heating may cause popping, movement of pouch and/or splattering. 1. Tear to vent. Place pouch standing upright in the microwave. 2. Microwave on High for 2 to 2-1/2 minutes. Careful, let stand in microwave for 1 minute. 3. Remove pouch from microwave using cool touch areas. Caution: pouch & product will be hot. 4. Pour soup into bowl and stir before serving.Stove Top Directions: Open pouch and pour soup into medium saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally until hot. Refrigerate leftovers in separate container. Do not re-heat pouch.The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.",4.0

She said it was good and not too hot for me.So I tried it just plain on a saltine to get an idea of the flavor and was happily surprised. This hot sauce has a ton of flavor, the heat is slow and not ""scorch your tongue so you can't taste anything."" The peppers and spices used are great, and the consistency is nicely thick without being too thick. Just right for adding to all sorts of things. That night we had tacos for dinner, and it was perfect, the sauce flavors carried well as a condiment and didn't disappear into the seasoning for the tacos and the taco flavor wasn't burned out by pure heat.My whole family likes this sauce, and that doesn't happen often. Usually we have 3 or 4 bottles of hot sauce going at a time because everyone prefers a different flavor. My husband doesn't like sauces that are too vinegary, my son prefers the strong vinegar sauces. My son and daughter both love lots of heat, and I prefer good flavor. The sauces we can all compromise on aren't ones that we are very enthused about. This one is exceptional because everyone in my family loves it.Yes, I recommend it.",5.0

This information should be made readily available.  The website also cautions that you should not drink more than two bottles a day, spaced several hours apart, and that you should not drink them at all if you are pregnant, nursing, or under twelve years old, although I don't see this information on the label.

So far, I've used it on southwest chicken salad (romaine topped with grilled chicken, black beans, corn, diced red bell pepper, jack cheese, and some chopped fresh tomato).  It compliments those flavors well.  Because it's so thick, you don't need to use a lot to get the flavor spread around.

Unfortunately, the bottle is too small to make that an economical choice, and this is intended instead as a ""finishing sauce.""  For example, adding it to tacos or burgers for a little extra kick.  If you like spicy food, this will not be enough, but it adds a little heat.I'm not sure that I would buy this over the translucent sauce, but it is very good.

890,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B006MONQMC,"I like stuff that you can add to water, so I was a bit excited to taste this. It boasted a lot of positives: vitamins, caffeine (yay!), and electrolytes. I like feeling like I'm getting more than just a flavoring, so the idea behind this sounded pretty good.Then I actually got the product.First the taste. It's meh. It's hard to mess up fruit punch, but this is just sort of bland. There's no *punch* to this punch and it has that strange aftertaste that you get when you use certain sweeteners or add vitamins to it. I was expecting this to a degree, but when it's mixed in with the lack of pow in the fruit punch it's very noticeable.Now for the packaging. This is just horribly designed overall. The first thing is that this is HUGE, about the size of a small bottle of soda. It's not very easy to carry with you and when it comes to exercise and such, you need portability and this bottle doesn't have it. It's good in a way since you have a lot of the product if you're really into it, but if you're hoping to have something small like a Mio bottle or a packet of Crystal Light that you can slip into your purse or bag, this isn't that item. Then there's getting into the darned thing. The pull tab under the cap is as easy as ""pull and peel"" as it claims to be. I had to use my nails to claw this off, which was just a little irritating. This in itself isn't a deal breaker like the bottle's size might be for some people, but it is aggravating.In the end this just didn't wow me enough to where I'd really want to buy this when the current bottle runs out. I can see where it could be good for someone who is dying to have the electrolytes and such, but there's got to be something better out drink-wise there that's sugar-free and low/no calorie. Flavor-wise, stick to your Crystal Light and Mio bottles. I'm giving it an additional star for the vitamins and stuff that it has with it, but otherwise this is just sort of a flop for me.",2.0

Dislikes: small cookies-2 cookies are a serving size and 150 calories and these cookies are about the size of a silver dollar, the cookies though soft and fudgy on the inside are dry on the top, if they were just a bit softer and less dry they would remind me of how fresh out of the oven cookies get that nice melty center when you hit the chocolate chips.

I liked the coffee, it smelled and tasted very good and the individually sealed pods assure long term freshness.  The pods appear to be made of high quality unbleached paper and it is strong enough to not tear or break open when saturated with hot water.  I do not own a single serve drip coffee maker so my first try was to open four pods and pour the coffee into my four cup basket and filter.  This worked well.  Then I thought I'd try something different the next time and placed four pods into my coffee maker basket.  This resulted in an entirely too weak brew.  But my experiment led me to discover the best method for using the handy little pods when no one cup maker is available.  When I saw that I had a pot of hot weak coffee I took the pods out of the basket and dropped them into the hot coffee.  I let them sit and steep for a while then plucked each pod out, squeezed, and discarded.  Now I had a good brew, as good as my first.  From then on when I use these pods I place one pod with about 8 oz of distilled water in a ten ounce mug and heat it good and hot in the microwave.  Remove from microwave and cover to retain heat while it brews.

The tea comes in two golden foil sleeves, which are visible through a leaf cutout.  The package opens like a little jewelry box, and has nice designs on the interior.  It makes the whole experience more special and I hope more manufactures put thought into that aspect.With easy access to teas from around the world, there has been an increasing trend for Americans to switch to British teas like PG Tips or Typhoo.  These teas are strong, punchy, and dark.  They are the tea equivalent of a cup of coffee, and can stand up to cream and sugar (or creamer) like coffee.  What Lipton is calling ""Natural Energy"" could just as easily be called ""British Style.""  One bad goes much further, and the flavor is robust.  I tried it first black, and the flavor is wonderful.  It does lack a bit of the bitter kick of PG Tips that I enjoy, but that is a personal preference.  I then tried it with cream and sugar, which is normal Lipton is too weak to work well with.  The packaging recommended giving this a try, and I tend to be obedient.  Surprisingly, this combination worked fantastically.  The tea flavor was still present and shined through the rich additions.As a fan of stronger black teas, I am excited to have a Lipton variety available in local stores.

This will seem very obvious to most, but the reason that I mention this is that this will not taste just like the other Swiss Miss products and obviously not like something you'd get at your local coffee shop. I've had a few friends complain about various diet cocoa mixes, so I thought I'd address this straight off.The good thing is that even though you'll be able to tell a difference between this and other non-diet mixtures, this is still a very good product. It has a nice richness to it that surprised me. It's been a few years since I've tried Swiss Miss's diet cocoa and I have to say that the formula has improved. I used to have to put two packets into a cup to get a decent flavor out of their mixes but it looks like they've worked on improving that end. I would recommend that you use slightly less hot water than is recommended, as this will make the drink a little thicker and the flavor a little richer.My only big issue is that this didn't mix in as cleanly as I wanted it to. The water I used was almost blisteringly hot, so it wasn't an issue of water temperature. This isn't a big problem as most powder mixes have this issue, but I know it'll bug some consumers. The other issue is of course the issue of taste: you'll know that this is diet, especially if you're making this with water as opposed to milk or non-dairy alternatives.Overall I'd recommend this and I'll likely purchase some of this in the future when this box runs out.

It may sound crazy, but the first thing we did was enjoy the sauce atop a David's chocolate truffle cheesecake and we all loved the complex flavors and textures. A few days later, I needed something to dress my simple avocado, so I put a spoonful in the cavity. The seeds were much appreciated giving the smooth texture of the plain avocado a little crunch. We had fantastic sandwiches made of crunchy peanut butter, sweet pickles and this sauce on home-made multigrain bread, and we'll do it again. A couple days later, I prepared Quorn naked cutlets (phony chicken breast) by basting them with the sauce which created a lovely glaze, then crumbled a little goat cheese on top, running them under the broiler for a minute. It was a winning use of this versatile sauce and really brought out the flavors more than uncooked uses. This morning we tried it on belgian waffles with a luscious compote of fresh strawberries and figs, and it was another hit.I have only two criticisms of this sauce. Sugar is the first ingredient and we don't eat much sugar. I'm assuming that in order to maintain the integrity of the fruit, it must be necessary to sweeten the pot so the sauce doesn't become a hot sauce, but remains a fruit sauce with a kick. Secondly, the natural smoke flavor was a notch above the heat of the peppers in intensity, so I'll be thinking of ways to counteract that flavor which could be overpowering. If you like very hot condiments and are looking for a replacement to your Chipotle flavored Tabasco Sauce, this is not what you need, but if you're looking for a fruity sauce with heat, I'd recommend this product.",5.0

Once both were ready, I moved the couscous into the boiling water while I sauteed the zucchini in the same pan along with 1/2 onion.What I noticed when I was working with the couscous was that it had a wonderful garlic aroma, which later translated into a wonderful garlic flavoring. However, while it shows picture of parsley on the cover, they translate to little green dots of parsley in the couscous (the reason I gave it four stars).Anyway, once the couscous was cooked (12 minutes) and the zucchini was also nicely brown, I fluffed the couscous and mixed it into the frypan for a final saute before I served it along with the meat.Low calorie?

I'm somewhat picky when it comes to pre-sweetened sweet teas, as sometimes it's too artificial tasting. This will probably never take the place of the sweet tea that you make and sweeten yourself, but it's a nice thing to have in a pinch or for when you don't want to go through all of the trouble of making a proper pitcher of sweet tea.The good thing about this tea is that it's fairly good and strong. This means that it's really not something you'd drink without ice, as the melting ice actually waters down the beverage just enough to where it's not super strong. Of course, if you try to get around that by adding more than the proper amount of water (about 8 ounces) then you'll get something that is quickly watered down when the ice really starts to melt.I think the only thing I'd really say needs work about this is the artificial sweetener. I'm used to this element somewhat, as many restaurants tend to use artificial sweeteners, but it still somewhat stands out here and not entirely in a good way. It's not so bad that I'd never drink this or that I'd tell others to avoid it, but if you're especially sensitive to artificial sweetener flavors then you'll probably want to stick to the old fashioned route: brew the tea and add your own stuff.",4.0

A good dose of chili-garlic sauce, a splash of rice vinegar, and using sesame oil rather than neutral vegetable oil gave it a nice flavor and the bits of cashews left in the bottom of a bag gave a little textural contrast to the thin noodles though I considered a little peanut butter instead.This flavor is more successful than some of the cheesy ones but it isn't quite as filling.

PGTips makes their bags from paper though, and Lipton uses an odd plastic micropore mesh. The choice for PET as the tea bag is something I don't like about Lipton Pyramid teas. The tetrahedron shape does allow more flow through and more ingredients than a flat bag which makes PGTips a stronger tea than most. Unfortunately, that's not true with this blend.The main ingredient in this is rose hips which create a different kind of tang than hibiscus. I like both hibiscus and rose hip teas and did like the tartness, but it was very delicate. This is best brewed with water just below the boiling point and left to steep for about 10 minutes. It doesn't become bitter like some herbals can with over steeping, but that does allow the scent and flavor to develop more fully. The taste is too delicate for my husband who thinks it tastes like re-used tea bags instead of a properly brewed first cup. I like do like it a bit more. The scent is lovely. There are a lot of orange elements that make the scent of the dry bag very orange, but the brewed tea didn't seem to live up to the promise of the scent.

I particularly like these whole grain noodles, since they offer more flavor than the white noodles.

It takes just one minute in the microwave to heat it, then you dump the sauce on the pasta. I found that it needs a few seconds more after the sauce has been applied to be heated throughout (just about 15 or so seconds).While keeping the sauce separate from the pasta certainly benefits the texture of the pasta, it also makes it easy to burn yourself when peeling off the lid.

I fry it in butter, then fix it with the measurements on the side. When it is complete, I add vegetables also fried in butter. In this one, I suggest that if you have leftover chicken, chopping it up and adding it (along with your own fresh veggies) will really bring out the flavor. Plus the chicken will add enough protein that you can use this as a meal for two - especially nice with a side salad.Worth trying ... probably wouldn't buy a pack of eight here on Amazon without checking it out with my family first.Four stars.",4.0

I usually drink a lot of bottled water when working outside in the heat or while exercising. I can down a regular bottle of water in a few seconds but this bottle will last me a while.The cost per bottle is a little on the high side but you have to factor in the size of the bottle.

The one thing I immediately noticed was the high concentration of omegas.  I&#8217;m always interested in finding foods with things like calcium and the omegas rather than taking supplements.  A single serving has 2,440mg of omega-3 and 708mg of omega-6.I checked out the fish oils I now have on board and the concentration of omegas in the chia seeds is much higher.  Organic is also a real plus for me and the fact that it&#8217;s in food form is a real plus.  The chia is dark in color and looks like miniature poppy seeds.  A few other plus factors is that the seeds are non-GMO, vegan, gluten free, grain free, and organic.  Can&#8217;t get much better than that.According to Viva Labs their &#8220;Viva Labs Organic Chia Seeds are 100% natural, GMO-free and a delicious way to increase the nutritional value of your food. With 4 grams of fiber and 2,440 milligrams of Omega-3s in every serving, this superfood hero helps support your overall health and well-being.&#8221;I didn&#8217;t want to add it to my salads because the seeds are tiny and my have ended up in the bottom of the salad bowl.  Instead I put some on my oatmeal, which already had some flax seed in it.  With a bit of adjustment, I could figure out just how much I needed to add to get the recommended omegas.The taste was negligible and didn&#8217;t alter the nutty taste of my oatmeal nor did any of it lodge in my teeth (I hate that).  There are approximately 37 servings in this bag and with the price equals out to about the same amount as a decent organic fish oil supplement.  No mercury in these chia seeds and they are certainly an easy way to get those omegas.  I&#8217;d very highly recommend these chia seeds and undoubtedly when my fish oil supply gets low, I may use the Viva Labs chia seeds to get my omegas.Sample provided for review.",5.0

I decided to try the cereal both dry and with milk.  The multiple berries are tasty both ways. I really enjoyed this combination because the cereals I have now only have dried strawberries, so the addition of raspberries and blackberries are great!  As for the flakes, they were definitely better in milk.  On their own they were too crunchy and in my opinion too sweet.  Adding the milk allowed them to soften a bit and to release some of the sweetener into the milk.I would definitely think about buying this cereal again, but maybe only on Subscribe and Save if it were offered because the current price is actually a little more than what the manufacturer sells it for on their own website.",4.0

1470,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00B2JRNBM,"We always use Barilla pasta but I hadn't tried their microwave meals until now. This meal is 9 ounces and seems to be just about the perfect size for a light meal. It comes in a plastic dish and all you have to do is pull back a corner of the film and microwave it for one minute. Then remove the film and pour the sauce over the pasta. The sauce is stored and cooks in a separate cup and that helps to make sure your pasta dish tastes and looks as fresh as possible. It uses a little more packaging but I like this idea and agree it leads to a better bowl of pasta. The pasta itself is Gemelli which is two strands of pasta that is twisted together. This helps to hold sauce and helps it to remain al dente. The sauce is a good tasting mix of tomato sauce and ground meat that is seasoned with carrot, celery, onion and spices. My only complaint is about the amount of meat in this dish. My package only had about a teaspoon of ground meat in in and it wasn't even close to enough for me. For a microwave meal these are on the high end and more expensive side. So when I see meat sauce I am expecting a reasonable amount of meat.

The rice had a pleasant coral color but the little flavor there was at best subtle. I could discern a very mild hint of tomato and a lot of salt. The rice did not stick but that could be as attributable to coating it with oil as to this mix. While the seasoning mix contains neither carbs nor calories, it does weigh in at 880 mg of sodium.If your tastes run to the bland, colored rice they serve in high school cafeterias, this mix will help you get the color and requisite saltiness.

1121,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00934S5JM,My husband loves iced cookies but I normally only make them in the winter during the holiday season. The reason is because normally making sugar cookies is a lot of work. This mix really takes almost all the work out of the process. If you use a hand mixer or Kitchen Aid mixer the process is also much simpler.I put the mix in a bowl and beat in the butter. Then I added the egg. The dough came together perfectly and I formed a ball. Then I put the dough between two sheets of parchment paper. This made rolling out the cookies a dream. Nothing stuck and I used a biscuit cutter to get the cookies in a round shape just like the picture on the package. I then baked them for 14 minutes which was two more minutes than suggested.I liked that I didn't have to cool down the dough like when I make regular sugar cookies. I also used butter that was at room temperature and they worked fine. After baking I then put the cookies in the freezer to cool them down and made an icing. All you do is blend one tablespoon of butter into 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar. Then add in just a little milk to make the icing smooth. Then ice away and sprinkle withIndia Tree Sparkling Sugar - Confetti.I've tried Pamela's mixes before and have always been impressed. This is another winner. These are easy to make and delicious too. They are nice as an occasional treat and no one will be able to tell they are wheat-free! I thought they tasted as good as my butter cookie recipe.~The Rebecca Review,5.0
1149,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B0096RP84Q,"These Campbell's ""Go Soup"" pouches are very convenient and the two flavors we tried ""Creamy Red Pepper with Smoked Gouda"" and ""Chicken & Quinoa with Poblano Chiles"" were both quite good. The soups are designed to be microwaved in the bag, which works fine, my daughter pointed out that they likely would not fit well in her small dorm-room microwave.The package is actually two servings, so the nutritional information must be doubled if not being shared. This isn't really an issue since there is enough food in each for a full meal for one person or as a starter for two people.These are very handy to keep around for the quick meal and they certainly taste better than most canned soups.Recommended!CFH",4.0

These crackers did have a bit of an aftertaste- that's my main issue with them.  Eating them was fine, it was just an issue of aftertaste.  In sum, these are not unpleasant crackers, but the aftertaste probably means that I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them.",4.0

They are thinner than a standard cheez-it and have a powerful flavor. Cheezy and spicy, but not too much so.  I would say this one may have a more subtle flavor and you can taste a bit more of the corn in these, but both flavors are really good-definitely cheesy with a little zing to them.

If anything, I noticed the pepper more than the lemon flavoring. It comes with six crackers, which still left me with about 1/3 of the tuna left. The packaging was nice, since I was able to keep the tuna and crackers in it while I ate. You don't have to drain the tuna (like you do in some) or mix in anything. Just open, scoop (spoon included) and eat.Given the strong tuna flavor, I really would prefer this on a salad, with the crackers on the side. Just a bit too strong for my taste.",3.0

460,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B003YBLF2E,"As a child, Lunchables held a great bit of wonder for me.  Too expensive to afford very frequently, but oh so awesome when we could.  I think it had something to do with the food being arranged in a certain way and the fun of putting it all together.  As an adult, I no longer feel that way about them or would even want to eat one, but some of that magic feeling came back as I opened the gopicnic box for the first time.  Everything is arranged in a snazzy way in little packages, and it comes with a plastic fork (I thought I would want a knife, but the fork worked better).  The box is also printed with some fun facts and includes a Sudoku puzzle, though I chose to eat on it to keep from making a mess.  Can I ditch work and go play?Okay, with that out of my system, I will talk about the food.  First, it was quickly apparent that this is geared toward health-conscious people.  No corn syrup, MSG, or trans-fats (the opposite of Lunchables!).  The salmon spread was my greatest fear, but it was actually yummy.  Not too fishy, and the lime flavor is subtle and not grossly artificial like it often is in other products.  The texture is typical spread -- thick enough to not make a mess at work when applying to the included 6 crackers.  Speaking of work, I don't think the smell is strong enough to offend those around you.Dry roasted edamame is included in a generous portion.  I found this tasty and you may even want to keep some to snack on over time.  The flavor is pretty neutral and not too salty.My favorite part was the Ginger Zip mix, which is ginger peanuts, cranberries, and banana chips.  The texture is not too hard or chewy and the amount of ginger is just right.  My only complaint is that there is not much of it!A block, which breaks into two pieces, of organic dark chocolate is included to finish the meal.  It is just the right amount to end on a high note without being overbearing, since this is lunch/snack and a brownie or something like that might leave me feeling gross.Overall, I love these!  Like Lunchables, I am afraid they cost a bit much to eat on a daily basis, but they make a nice treat for here and there when I'm feeling a bit down.  For me, a 410 calorie pack is a substantial lunch and I had trouble finishing it, but I also keep to a pretty strict diet in general.  You could always add more crackers if you want to stretch it, because there is enough spread for more.",5.0

She liked it too.The collection reminded me of the snack meals provided by airlines just before they stopped providing meals at all.  To their credit, GoPicnic has worked to avoid including artificial colors and flavors. I think that this would be a good choice to bring with you on a flight. However, in the end, you are left with a very large pile of wrappers.

The peach is not fully &#34;natural,&#34; but it tastes more like a peach than peach candy.

1700,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B00DBSG2HS,"Homemade cookies are amazing.  I guess that goes for most homemade food, and that is partly because we don't need to use all the strange industrial ingredients when we cook at home.  These Keebler Simply Made butter cookies seemed like a good compromise for convenience, and after eating a few, I think that they generally are.  However, the taste is not so strongly of butter and vanilla as a homemade cookie.  Perhaps those natural flavors mellow out after being packaged for a while.  The texture is not crisp on the outside and moist on the inside like a traditional cookie.  It is more of a crunchy shortbread.  If anything, I would compare these to Pecan Sandies from Keebler, minus the pecans.Given the above, why would I rate these cookies 4 stars?  Because the flavor is simple and unassuming, but pleasant.  They are not for everyone, but work well as an old fashioned snack.  Perhaps more exciting are the possibilities of using these cookies in recipes, ice cream topping, etc.  When I use standard cookies in recipes, like Oreos, there is always that unfortunate chemical aftertaste that brings down the overall effect of a homemade dessert.

Great as-is with sauce, or makes a prefect side dish when dressed with some butter and grated cheese. Also works well in soups without having to break up the pasta first.

I will say that I think that 8 ounces was probably a little too much water for my tastes, but this can very easily be adjusted for taste. That's actually not really my problem. My problem was that I could never really forget that I was drinking a mix powder as opposed to something made with a liquid or a tea bag. This isn't really a deal breaker. I'm just sort of particular when it comes to chai drinks, although this one is far better than some of the other stuff I've had in the past from various different brands people have given me.One of its winning features is that it mixes up super, SUPER easily. Anyone who has had a powdered mix clump up on them can commiserate with this. This blended in very easily and quickly, which I liked.

Firstly, I bake a lot and use applesauce or pureed prunes instead of oil and/or sugar in some recipes.  Secondly, my mother is unable to chew much these days, and I was thinking of sending some purees to help my folks achieve better nutrition.  Thirdly, having recently experienced some GI problems, I wanted to have pureed foods in my pantry in case I have another flare-up that necessitates a temporary change to soft foods in my diet.  Since I had relied on some pureed baby foods in the past, I liked the option of BPA free packaging that appeared to take up less storage space and the ingredient list was enticing.Well, the glowing praise I read about Baby Gourmet Organic foods on the web has it right!  Stage 1 foods are sold for 6 month old infants, and I wish these had been available when my daughter was young.  I would have saved so much time as I routinely pulled out the Happy Baby Food Grinder to prepare her nourishment!  I find the green vegetable flavor in this puree to be slight, not as strong as plain broccoli and spinach, with the pear sweetening it just right -- good combination for newly developing baby palates.  Now on to my experiences... I used this product in baking zucchini bread and it was outstanding!  I've frozen a couple pouches, then sliced them open for an ""instant sorbet"" of sorts.  It was quite good and I'm sure that if one has dental work done or is recovering from an ailment, this will be a welcome food source.  Regardless, it's a swell summer treat.The removable cap is small, so if you do have kids as most consumers likely do, I'd recommend taking care with its safety.  Being able to easily close the pouch is a strength, particularly since each pouch contains two servings for an infant.  The pouch should not be microwaved, but placed in hot water if warming desired.  This food has gained my approval and I'm preparing to order some for my mother.

Mind you, many people won't like it this way so just take it as a suggestion.  The ""regular"" cooking instructions are on the box.  I added halved grape tomatoes and mixed them in for added color and a bit of zest.The taste was excellent and it did have that ""Tuscan"" taste I associate with pasta dishes I've had in restaurants.

There is 12 g of sugar, 4g of fiber and 20% of your daily iron.

I like my water sweetened up, so that is pretty much perfect for me, but I could see that a 20 oz bottle would probably be sufficient and still be sweet enough for most people especially if they don't like their drinks quite so sweet.  I liked the flavor-  It has a little bit of tartness and a light coconut taste that I really found refreshing.  I had just drank a bottle of water and put in the packet first then the water and this didn't seem to take so long to get incorporated into my water with a little bit of shaking.

The extra tuning and tweaking to add additional ""stuff"" to counter the sugar defeats the purpose of buying  this packet, I might as well make the dressing from ""scratch"".The saving grace is that the sugar in the dry seasoning packet makes a good rub for meats to be grilled or BBQ'ed.

I enjoyed drinking it but not as much as expected. Each 8.45 fluid ounce can has 100 calories which is a little more than I would expect for such a small size.

Like other Knorr Rice Sides, this Creole Garlic kind is really easy to make, but the flavor does not deliver as others.

The price is a bit high for some pasta and rice and since it needs more than what comes in the package, I might have to pass and not get this kind.",3.0

I was a little concerned being sick and having a non desire to taste anything unusual but I was surprised to find out how satisfying these teas were.This is really more like a cup of light hot soup.  Not broth based but just water and flavors.  I like all the ingredients listed so I thought the combinations were pretty good.  My favorite probably was the spinach chive and the broccoli cilantro, maybe because I REALLY like those vegetables and herbs.  I even squirted some fresh lemon juice in these two and they were great.  My other favorite was the carrot curry, I really like the sweetness of it.  My least favorite was the tomato mint only because I am not much of a fun of mint with anything but ice cream or chewing gum.Overall it was a good thing for me but it really depends on the flavors you are familiar with and also think of these teas more like soup rather than an herb tea.",4.0

1313,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B009UQGLGW,"I will be completely honest. This is not as good as the more heavy duty reusable filters. If you're the type of person who only uses the Keurig in one location, you'll want to stick with the more durable filters. If you're the type who uses a Keurig in multiple locations, these filters are good to have on you.These are reusable, but they have a very limited life span. They only have about 20 uses (more or less depending on how much you pack in there and how rough you are on them) and while that isn't as good for people who want something more durable, it is good for those who want to travel with a reusable filter but don't necessarily want to take around their normal reusable filter. I can vouch that at my workplace someone tried bringing their own reusable filter in, only for it to meet a rather untimely and mysterious end. (In other words, it was abused regularly by others before it ended up disappearing somewhere.)There is a level of messiness to this, so it's not the handiest thing out there. You'll need to dry this out before storing it and you'll want to be careful about how you carry it with you. It's durable enough, but is still somewhat fragile and easily crushed enough if you're clumsy like I am and carry a purse that weighs about 10 pounds. This is really the only drawback of the filter.This is still a decent product and if you don't want to carry around a more permanent filter, it's a good general use. I would, however, recommend the more durable and longer lasting filters if you could. Part of me acknowledges the need for this but I still cringe slightly at the idea of a disposable filter.

Next, I dropped in a few frozen shrimp, gave it a good stir, let it come to a boil again, and then turned it down to a simmer and covered the pot.  I really enjoyed it!This is basically rice and little pieces of vermicelli bathed in a garlicky golden broth and it was quite good.  It wasn't too salty and it really set off the shrimp.  I don't usually buy this type of packaged food but it was so easy and so good that I will be keeping a pouch on hand for exactly this type of easy, one-pot meal.  With a salad or a couple of vegetables, it could easily serve as a meal for two.This particular Knorr Side dish should be popular with hikers because it would be so tasty with summer sausage, canned or dried shrimp, Spam singles, or maybe even tuna.  It is very tasty when made with olive oil and for those trying to increase calories, it could stand up to quite a bit of it.  It is also nice that it doesn't stick to the pot like the versions with cheese do.The package says it is ""made with a hint of hickory smoked ham flavor"" but there are no pork products on the label and it seems to refer to the torula yeast extract.  It's still not vegan because it has some dairy ingredients but I do think it is vegetarian.My only complaint is that I do wish Knorr would use whole-grain rice and pasta as it's quite a bit healthier and the taste would hardly be noticeable because of the sauce.",5.0

My favorite is oatmeal!In terms of vanilla flavor, it is good, but not as good or &#34;natural&#34; as Amoretti.  The sweetness is pretty strong, and has the typical Splenda flavor and aftertaste.  That is good or bad depending on how you feel about Splenda.  Other brands have natural sweetener or unsweetened options if Splenda turns you off.Torani syrups are relatively low-priced and ubiquitous at grocery stores because they make a good compromise between flavor and cost.

While it offers the advantage of a filter material to ensure zero grounds make it into the cup, using it is far more cumbersome than other options.There are three pieces to the unit: an outer cup, and inner filter holder, and a lid. To set it up you put a filter on the inner holder then push the outer cup over it. Fill it with coffee and snap on the top.It worked fine in my Cusinart K-cup machine 9 out of 10 times. The 10th time the filter malfunctioned somehow, and the cup was filled with a lot of grounds. Not sure why that happened since the filter material was not damaged.But regardless of the malfunction (which I think was user error on my part), the coffee is not as robust as when I use non-filter replacement cups. The filter paper traps the oils which, for me, greatly diminishes the flavor. I'm willing to live with a little sediment in the bottom of the cup in exchange for a richer, deeper taste.Plus, there's the on-going cost and waste of the filters. I was able to make my own using some cheap 8 cup basket filter paper from a warehouse club. Just cut it into a 3 and 3/8 inch diameter circle, and you're good to go. (Note: the failure I describe above was not with a home-made filter, but with an original one from the box. No problems using the home made ones).

1091,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,B0091146V8,We've been using a reusable coffee filter for years now as we are cheap and don't like buying expensive K-Cups.  We brew several cups of coffee a day and have always had a preference to the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.Assembly- It's easy to assemble this set but it dirties 4 pieces and requires a disposable filter whereas my normal one only dirties 3 pieces and I don't need to buy costly disposable filters.Coffee- With this set I never have any coffee ground in my cup.  With my normal one I do.  It's not much but I've just always been in the habit of not drinking the very last sip in my cup.  They both taste the same.  Neither one makes my coffee too strong or too weak.Clean Up- With this set I have to go to the trash can and put my finger through the hole to push the filter out and then cup my hand under the the remaining pieces as I walk to the sink to rinse out the coffee that remains caked on one of the pieces.  It's simple to rinse and set up for your next cup of coffee.  With my normal set I just walk to the sink and rinse out the filter.  It doesn't rinse out as easily as the other one.  I have to use my finger to wipe around the inside of the filter to get all the coffee out.  I then have to use a paper towel and wipe it thoroughly to continue to get the ground out.Overall this is an OK set if you don't mind buying disposable filters.  My preference will always be for the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter for that reason.  To me it's just a bit easier and faster than having to put assemble this system like a puzzle and there's never anything more to buy after the initial purchase.,3.0

A bit pricy in my book, but it is what it claims it is.But my key question was, what does it mean that it has natural caffeine? And is there a difference?In one sense, the two are structurally identical. However, since synthetic caffeine is purer, it is absorbed faster and gives a faster ""jolt."" but it also, in the pure form allows a faster letdown.Normally, you get natural caffeine when drinking coffee or tea, or consume many other forms of caffeinated products, including my personal favorite, chocolate.So where does the natural caffeine in water come from? Actually, according to their web site, it comes mainly from coffee beans. Companies that sell decafeinated coffee or tea have to process it to remove the caffeine. The caffeine that is extracted is sold to companies who want to add caffeine to their products. This includes soda companies who gain a majority of their caffeine from this process.So the caffeine you are drinking here is taken out of the same beans you use to make your morning coffee. If you would like to skip the middleman, and enjoy the taste of coffee, you can just brew a fresh cup, even have an iced cup.I have given this five stars because it is exactly what it says it is, and because it tasted exactly like water to me.  It also comes in a recyclable bottle with no BPA. Would I buy it? Probably not at the current price point. I'll stick with other sources of caffeine that come in a washable mug, no recycling needed. :-)",5.0

1691,A3VI2VETB90ZG5,B00DBSFXUK,"I'm not too thrilled with this particular ""Zings"" this flavor. It is no different than many of the spiced-up flavors of many snacks that have popped up this past decade or two. I am not turned off by the notion of chiplotle and cheddar, I am just unimpressed with this particular implementation.The first Cheez-It tastes like a typical Cheez-It, with pleasant cheddar cracker flavor, with a chipotle twist. Then three or four crackers in, the spice dominates the flavor. I suppose this is a nice way to keep people from eating too many at one time.Cheez-It Zings Chipotle Cheddar crackers are just one more attempt to utilize a spice that is so cheap and abundant. The overwhelming spice quickly drowns out the core flavor of the snack. Of course, this may be touted at south of the border flavor, but I've been south of the border many times, and I'm not sure they would like it anymore than I do.I recommend this product to those who enjoy snacks that are covered in red powder. The Zings are not covered in red powder, but I am guessing that if you have the palate for those, you may like these as well. If you like to try everything once, then these aren't horrible in any way, so go ahead. If you're looking for something completely different, then you may be disappointed.",3.0

In fact, we often had it for lunch with crackers as soup.Today I use canned broth as a substitute because of the sodium content (it is a bummer to grow up). Anyway, these teas appeal to me in this context, something different that I can use as a quick substitute for maintaining my diet and blood sugar while having satisfactory taste.If they didn't use the word tea, rather, used the word broth, most of us would know better what to expect.Anyway, I actually have used these not only to drink but I also dropped a couple of tea bags in my crock-pot with a roast to flavor it. They are an unexpected taste, and if you are considering the savory teas, this is a nice selection to start with since they offer a variety. So far, Tomato Mint is my favorite.A new direction for beverages ... I must admit I like it.",5.0

Better than MIO, in my opinion, I find that this gives me a very little boost when added to my water bottle for consumption while I work in my garden.  When I first tasted the drink prior to adding it to water, it reminded me of the liquid vitamins I gave to my daughter many years ago and I expected to not like it at all.  In the diluted state, it is rather refreshing and I expect to be able to consume a bottle within the thirty days it apparently will last after opening.  The bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening and I'd recommend not storing them in a heated environment.  Although caffeine is listed near the top of ingredients, I did not feel the effects when mixed as directed.  I imagine that for those who are drinking this for the jolt, you'd find it necessary to make a more concentrated solution and then you'd have the vitamins in excess.

The pasta didn't taste nearly as bad as it smelled but it was nothing special either. The smoke flavor tastes fake, the bacon is extremely small and they are hard little pieces like bacon bits. I would not recommend this pasta dish.",2.0
1957,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,B00H727M8M,I think this Nacho Cheddar Seasoning is pretty good.  Kinda similar in taste to the cheesy popcorn that you find in those big round tins at Christmastime.  Taste pretty good in my opinion and my family of 4 all enjoy it.This 8.5 ounce shaker is a good size.  I would like to point out though that this isn't one of those products where you'd say a little bit goes a long way.  It takes a pretty decent amount to get even coverage and the desired taste.  The good thing is it hardly has any calories.My family really likes this seasoning and I'd recommend trying it.,4.0

When I see ""Habanero"" in a product name, I expect a real ""kick,"" something that will sneak up and then take on an ""in your face"" assertiveness.  Not this sauce.  I mean, it has a bit of a bite to it, but no more than I'd expect from a relatively mild salsa.  It's good, but just not as hot as I expected.Then there's the sweetness.  It's just a bit too sweet for my taste.  Mango is a sweet fruit anyway, with very little acidity when it's ripe; add honey to that and you've got a *really* sweet mixture going on.  In my opinion, it needs a little more acid to balance it out -- lime or lemon, perhaps.I've used this sauce twice now:  as a finishing sauce for grilled chicken breast, and as a dipping sauce for coconut-crusted shrimp.  It worked fine, but next time I use it, I'll be adding some fresh-squeezed lime juice.All that aside, it IS a quality sauce, it tastes very fresh, no odd ""bottled"" flavor at all.  It's definitely good enough that I'll be giving a couple of other flavors a try.",4.0

It has a very pleasant aroma and a taste that is not overpowering. Each tea bag is sealed in an individual packet for freshness.It does have a very nice kick, meaning it has a good level of caffeine.

Compared to canola oil (processed with hexane), corn oil (always GMO) and shortening (usually hydrogenated), coconut oil is a natural, healthy oil that's actually good for you. I also like that coconut oil has a very long shelf life, so I can stock up when I find a good price or a superior product and not worry about it going rancid before I finish it.Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is probably the best of the coconut oils I've used. It's cold pressed and un-refined, which preserves all the nutrients, and it's organic so I don't have to worry about pesticides or bleaching. But the reason I like it so much is that it's delicious! I ate a teaspoon of it right out of the jar, and it has a wonderful aroma and flavor.

My husband disagreed and said it was completely foul. My son thought it was great and wants to have it on hand for quick meals.Does it taste like real, homecooked or restaurant marsala? Of course not. It's a convenience food. It's basically a thick sauce with little bits of mushrooms in it that you cook with chicken to serve over something else. It does need to be served over something because the sauce is way too salty just straight.I made it with chicken breasts and served over egg noodles. The egg noodles helped cut the salt to just salty. It's very easy to make, and if you use leftover chicken, takes no time at all.To me, the wine flavor came out strong and cheap. Since I normally only cook with wines I'd be willing to drink, it was a bit vinegary.As I said, my son really likes it. He's a 22 yo bachelor and considers this a great way to enhance his meals inexpensively. My husband, who is himself a decent cook, thought it was horrible and said ""I'd eat it if I were still in the military, it would help dehydrated beef patties.

Don't get me wrong, I did stir after cooking and in fact I continued to stir it up a bit while I was eating it.  Anyway, the bottom portion started not tasting very good and the noodles seemed to get a rough texture to them.  I ate the meal quickly so it's not like it was sitting around having he opportunity to change.  I'm not sure what the problem was.Overall I didn't think this meal was bad but it certainly wasn't great.  I could eat one of these every now and then but it won't be often.  I would recommend trying it for yourself to see if you like it.  Since it's just 212 calories it could be great for those that enjoy it.",3.0

One way to cut down on cooking time is to pre-soak the oats.

While the package lists blackberry juice solids, pomegranate is not listed. I assume it is included in the ""natural flavors"".Other ingredients are green tea, hibiscus flowers, citric acid, licorice root, chicory root, modified corn starch and soy and sunflower lecithin.  I understand that tea bags themselves are made from the corn starch. As far as the lecithins go, they are commonly used as emulsifiers and anti caking agents. Frankly, I would prefer to not have them in my tea.I think Lipton did consumers a disservice by placing the word ""superfruit"" on the box.

I personally like it, maybe because I know it is high in protein and fiber, so the healthy issue gets me more than the flavor.The texture is a bit different than simple semolina pasta.  It's like the penne is tougher and when cooking it al dente, it ends up with a harder texture - compared to the regular pasta cooked al dente.  My family liked it better when cooked a little longer (not al dente but not mushy either) but they weren't enthused about it.My sister in law buys this pasta regularly and often comments how her kids don't crave as many sweets during the day as they normally do, so she has all kinds of shapes of Barilla Plus.I might try other shapes maybe thin spaghetti and see if my family likes it better.

295,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B0026ZYZ7Q,"I've heard about pu'erh tea from a coworker of mine that just swears on the stuff, so I was curious to give this a try. The end result is that I was pleasantly surprised at how mellow this ultimately is, given that it's a dark tea. Most of these teas (like black tea) have a very strong and distinctive flavor. This does have that, but it's not nearly as strong tasting as I was expecting.The description of this compares it heavily to chai tea. It's been a while since I've drank the brewed chai tea, as I typically drink the pre-made Oregon Chai stuff, so I can't really tell you how similar this is to the steeped chai teas. This didn't immediately remind me of chai, but then my more recent memories of it are of the Oregon chai and that's pretty much a different beast than brewed chai. I did like the cardamom in this and it really compliments the base tea well.I have to say that I liked the overall taste of this. It has a distinctive flavor but it doesn't kick me in the teeth like some of the black teas do. I also like that I was able to steep this for a little longer than I normally do and it didn't get instantly bitter and undrinkable.As far as the antioxidant claims, I won't be able to back those up with just one box. That's the type of thing that you notice over a longer period of time, but I will say that my coworker has been drinking this stuff for a while now and swears by the stuff. Part of what she likes about it is that it's gentler on her system than black or green tea, so this might be something nice for people who find that these teas are too harsh for them. Caffeine-wise, it does the trick. It's supposed to have about 60-70 milligrams of caffeine, so approach this with caution if you're sensitive.EDIT:A friend recently gave me some pu'erh tea from a tea shop. I have to deduct star ratings because it was such a different tea experience and made this stuff well, ""swill"" in comparison. My coworker got to try a cup of this stuff and she didn't particularly like how it smelled, although she said the taste was well done enough, although not nearly as good as the ""real"" tea.",3.0

357,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B002NHSQ6I,"I received a sample of one Newman's dark-chocolate bar through the Vine program. I live in a part of the country where it is warm in the winter and the bar arrived slightly melted. I put it in the refrigerator to return it to a solid state--and I can imagine the shudders of chocolate connoisseurs since chocolate is not supposed to be refrigerated. It causes ""blooming,"" a grayish discoloration of the shine on the chocolate. The chocolate actually did discolor, but that didn't matter to me personally, because I love cold chocolate bars which are crunchy to the teeth and smooth to the tongue.I could go into all the ways that Newman's Own is a great company (it is), the fact that the ingredients in this chocolate are organic and healthier than those in a regular chocolate bar (they are), and that there's a lot of solid research that dark chocolate is good for your health (it is), but since several other reviewers have already covered all that and done a great job, I'll stick to the main issue:How does it taste?In my opinion--and I love chocolate--this bar tastes great. And particularly great for dark chocolate. Many regular dark-chocolate bars are, for my personal preference, rather too bitter. The bitterness that is supposed to be there as an essential part of the flavor experience of dark chocolate is present in this Newman's Own bar, but not to the extent that the bar doesn't offer a sweet treat.As for the texture, to me it felt quite smooth as it melted on my tongue. The aftertaste is excellent. It tastes just as good as the initial bite of the candy.What about the price? I wrote Amazon about the price today, and they wrote back it is going to cost $25.85. The suggested retail price appears to be $35.88 for 12 bars which comes to a little under $3 per 2.25 oz. (64 gm) bar. The Amazon discounted price comes to about $2.16 per bar, which is cheaper than any other source on the Internet is currently selling it.How does it compare to it's conventional, U.S. competitor,Hershey's Extra Dark Chocolate Bar? The Hershey's bars are larger, weighing in at 3.52 oz., and they come in a pack of 14 selling for $31 on Amazon. That's $2.21 for a larger bar. I haven't tasted that bar, but the reviewers who have claim much the same thing I am for this bar for the Hershey bar's taste, that it has great flavor with no bad aftertaste.In the end, since the taste is at least as good as its conventional competitor, the choice for a consumer as to whether to choose this product will probably come down to two main things: a desire to support the company selling it and/or the fact that this bar is organic and has a healthier sugar in it. As for myself, considering those two things, I would personally choose this bar.",5.0

There are a total of 24 pads moistened with a cleansing solution that has a nice lemon scent divided into four easily-resealable mylar bags.  The pads are simply relatively thin and lightly-abrasive Scotch-Brite pads.This tool does an excellent job of cleaning smooth flat surfaces, such as those induction cooktops, a vent hood, or even a bathtub.  Where it is not so good is on any kind of nook or cranny.  What I have discovered is that the pad is slightly stretchy and it's possible to stretch it a little so excess pad extends from two adjacent sides and that enables it to get into angles and corners.Now, it didn't turn my decades-old stovetop into a brand-new appliance but it did do a good job of getting off the normal mess that accumulates after a week.The pads are rinsable and can be reused several times.  They can also be used without the handle.The pads leave behind a little fiber on the handle but that can easily be removed.  The handle itself picks up greasy dirt that won't come off so it would be nice if it weren't white.  Also, it's two-tone with gray so I expected part of it to be soft-touch plastic but it isn't.

I realize we're trying to be healthy here in this product but golly, why does healthy mean ""taste like the box?"" I'm surprised that Ritz has a product like this because all of their other crackers are just awesome! I suppose if you dip them in ranch dressing that it might improve them but if so, there goes the healthy portion of the debate!

The nice thing about these bags is that they allow a lot of flow around the leaves in the bag instead of having it compacted tightly which really allows flavors to bloom in a shorter steeping time. Shorter steeping time means less bitter flavors so that's a good thing. Much like using a large tea ball only partly filled or actually brewing it with the tisane or tea mix in the pot and straining it out.While most of my family prefers classic teas generally, I'm an herbal tisane drinker (herbal teas). I didn't think I had a strong preference until realizing how many of my favorite blends had hibiscus in them. This one does, it makes for a very pretty tea with a bright, full, fruity flavor. The raspberries and rose hips add a lot of acidity. Vanilla isn't listed on the ingredients at all but something labeled ""Natural flavor"" does which could be where the hint of vanillin comes from. Vanilla is considered an ingredient, so if it were present, it would be listed.

1829,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B00DS842HS,"My husband and I use a lot of organic coconut oil for baking and as an addition to vegetable dishes. This particular brand is certified organic and non-GMO. It has not been processed with hexane or bleach and it is cold-pressed. It has an excellent aroma and flavor.Normally I use Garden of Life because it comes in a glass jar. However, the plastic used here is free of BPA's.For those with allergies: The label on the coconut oil warns that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.DISCLAIMER: I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs in order to test it out. I was under no obligation to write a review.",5.0

65,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B000FEH8ME,"Bars get a bad rap, and usually for good reason.  I'll admit to using ""diet"" bars many times to simplify weight loss or as quick meals.  Calorie content in those bars tends to be fine, but that's about it.  They are full of sugar and preservatives and somehow make me feel both gross and hungry when I eat them.  Though I understand the philosophy of ""everything in moderation,"" I think I've found something better in the Pure bars.  Calories are similar (190), but the ingredients are completely different.  Rather than being similar to a candy bar, these Pure bars are a simple mix of fruits and nuts, along with rice protein and agave nectar.  All of it is raw, organic, and straightforward, to the extent that it really tastes like something I'd make for myself.  The consistency is smooth and dense, with some nut chunks to add a bit of texture.  The blueberry flavor and consistency is pleasant and reminds me of fresh blueberries, rather than the somewhat metallic artificial blueberry flavor found in many munchies I've munched on.There are no mysteries to these bars, so I think you can make a pretty good guess at whether they fit into your life or not.  If they do, the only question is if it is worth the cost for the convenience or if you'd rather make your own.",5.0

1206,AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B009M515GW,"Side Mates original pearl couscous is great, and I prefer it to the smaller sort.  Unfortunately, the flavored versions, including this Portabella Mushroom and Sun-Dried Tomatoes variety, have a slimier texture and artificial flavor.  It could be related to the corn syrup or Yeast Extract (MSG), though the generic flavor makes it is hard to say exactly.  It is not gross, but not delicious.  As with other Side Mates, adding stuff helps.  I added sauteed eggplant.  However, if I am adding ingredients anyway, I would rather use the clean flavor of the original as a base.  In short, I'd only recommend this to someone who enjoys these sides and wants to try every flavor.  It is not something I would purchase, apart from a clearance price.",3.0

Adding a few drops to water, one instantly has an artificially sweetened and flavored product which on the positive side can make fans drink more water.  Because it has virtually no nutritional value, it's simply an enhancer to water, which we all should be drinking.  I tried this in a variety of concentrations and found it to be the most palatable in a glass of seltzer, using about half of the recommended dosage.  It dilutes quicker than powdered products like crystal light, and because it's in a resealable small bottle, storage is better.  I'd prefer it not be colored, but I'm sure the market researches determined that customrs needed to see that their water was flavored in addition to tasting it.  I'm curious to know if this is usable in the prep which is used for GI procedures like the colonoscopy, where crystal light is recommended for flavoring.  In that application, I think it would be great and would suggest that it be recommended.  Because I prefer this to other instant water enhancers, I'm giving the product 4 stars.",4.0

There are three packets of crackers inside the box, each containing seven crackers. Per the box label, a serving is two crackers at 110 calories with 2 grams of protein, 2 grams of fiber, and 2.5 grams of fat. The ingredients are graham flour (whole grain wheat), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, baking soda, monocalcium phosphate, sea salt, cinnamon, and vitamin E as a preservative. There are no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors, and no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated fats.The company who makes these crackers, Back to Nature, has been in business for over 50 years. Their carton is made of recycled paperboard, and Back to Nature states it supports the Nature Conservancy, a leading conservation organization.Now to the main point: How do they taste? Personally, I think they are the best tasting graham crackers I've ever had. I love the crispy texture and the lightly sweet taste. I'm looking forward to using these to make graham-cracker crust with coconut oil. It should be really delicious.

Green tea is so much less forgiving than black tea, breaking it up and putting it in a bag makes it so much harder to brew a good cup that isn't bitter.  On that note, I must give this product credit.  This tea brewed with no hint of bitterness (using a cooler temperature, as one would do for other green teas).  That said, this tea does have quite a strong lemongrass-lemon flavor, and that gives these tea bags some latitude.  I tasted much more citrus than I did green tea.  That's not necessarily bad, if that's what one wants.  The main issue I see is that this tea is marketed as straight green tea, when it's really a flavored product, first and foremost.

Uh-oh, what's the other 10% of ingredients?Turns out palm oil, sugar and salt.I like peanut butter with its natural flavor and not diluted with a vegetable oil, sugar and salt. I tried to scrape off some of the peanut butter off the muffin. It just tastes oily to me instead of the natural peanutty taste I like from 100% peanut butter. A few years ago, before a nutritionist suggested I switch to a 100% peanut-based peanut butter, I would have liked this flavor. So, I can understand why some people like this. It is easy to spread and smooth. However, now that my taste-buds have adjusted to the 100% peanuts, I prefer that and find this a tad diluted. I don't like sugar in peanut butter either.I don't need extra oil, sugar and salt in my diet, so wouldn't buy this peanut butter. Planters are known for peanuts, so would think they would make a natural, all-peanut peanut butter instead of something diluted with ingredients that we don't need more of in our diet. Okay, so palm oil, sugar and salt are ""natural"". But so is arsenic, but you wouldn't eat it as it's not good for you.I didn't like the taste as much compared to 100% peanut butter, or the added ingredients, and the less healthy aspect of this peanut butter. If you prefer the taste of this peanut butter, probably wouldn't worry too much about the 10% palm oil, salt and sugar. Would think of it as a dessert you eat occasionally. However, if you want to eat the healthiest peanut butter there is, would try a 100% peanut butter. A nutritionist recommended a brand to me that I like and try to buy.

The cereal's number one ingredient is corn meal.  This is ok.  I have consumed many boxes of Kellogg's Corn Flakes.The texture is indeed crunchy which is nice in a cereal. The taste is on the sweet side, if you are used to unsweetened cereals.  The cereal does live up to its middle name, vanilla.  The vanilla flavor is quite apparent.  This is to bring back memories of ""cookies fresh from Grandma's oven.""My big disappointment is that this cereal is almost one-quarter sugar, e.g., 10.5 grams of sugar of a total of 45 grams per cup. This is almost as much sugar as there is in a tablespoon of granulated sugar which comes in at 13 grams. By contrast, Kellogg's Corn Flakes has 3 grams of sugar per cup, Cheerios has 1 gram of sugar per cup, and Shredded Wheat has zero grams of sugar. The sugar comes from cane juice. It is real sugar, not the fake high-fructose stuff. It may not be corn syrup, but it certainly is not wholesome. Sugar has been associated with diabetes, obesity, hyperactivity in children, and may be addictive.It seems to me that Nature's Path has gone to a lot of effort to use organic, natural ingredients to create this new cereal.  Amazingly, the result is a product that appears to be totally artificial.

Current packs have 160 calories, 33 carbs, 200 mg sodium, 4g protein, 2g fat (none saturated). Fiber is 4 grams, one of them soluble.  Potassium is 140mg and sugars 12g.So, for 160 calories, this is an economical, fast, easy, fiber-providing dessert. For me, this is just not breakfast. But we all differ in how we view processed stuff and sweet stuff. :DHTH,",4.0

The flavor is quite nice, sweetened but not so much so that it gags you, and the peach flavor is quite present but not overpowering.  It is very refreshing, just awesome actually. One of those products you literally stumble upon and see yourself using it the rest of your life.  Kids love it too so that's the ultimate test in my book!  It's best with ice cubes though - the flavor kinda grabs you otherwise.  You don't need much - just a bit of a squirt into an 8-ounce glass of water and you're done.  The package will last for about 10-12 glasses of good tea, which isn't too bad and it doesn't need refrigerated after opening.  You need to use it within 30 days, however, after opening.Great product, a great idea and a very fast pick-me-up at work.  Highly, highly recommend!",5.0

The raisins were pretty good. Plump and sweet mostly, but a good third were rather dried out and more chewy than I would prefer. The candy was just OK on their own, but add a nice touch to the mix.I do wish the bag was smaller. The bag has 4 servings, each at 160 calories.

Orville Redenbacher is the name in popcorn so even when plugged as having 1/2 the fat of regular potato chips, I was expecting munch nirvana. The kernels are surprisingly large and symmetrical. They have a slight sweetish glaze and are sprayed with a weird cheese-like substance. The flavor is off, more chemical than cheese and it overwhelms the very mild popcorn taste. The product is gluten free and a 3/4 cup serving has 130 calories and 5 grams fat. It was edible but not especially enjoyable. The package is not resealable and the product was nice and fresh.

It avoids the ""grassy"" taste that I've encountered with some green teas, and is decaffeinated (although even regular green tea is rather low in caffeine). The added flavors come through well, with citrus being the most prominent.As with all green teas, it's best when brewed at lower temperatures to avoid bitterness. For my taste, 165 degrees is just right, but the acceptable range for green tea brewing is about 140 to 185.But even when brewed at a lower temp and steeped for some time, the resulting tea was on the weak side, even for green tea standards. The added flavorings helped boost up the flavor, but it still was flatter than I would like.But a generally good effort, and I did enjoy the added flavors. Four stars.",4.0

The ""to go"" packages are all over the place now and if you've been in a convenience store recently, you'll find them right near the water.

Honey granules are a very popular sweetener, but so is Splenda.  In essence the reason these drinks are so sweet is because of the sucralose which is marketed under several names.  If you have problems with this, you can simply take a pass.  All of the information is not hidden, but here on the pictures for everyone to take a look at.Personally, I do love the taste of these ""teas,"" which taste more like fruit drinks than they do tea.

We drink a lot of coffee, both from a traditional drip brewer and from the Keurig, so we usually have ground coffee and various flavor K-Cups on hand. While I like the speed and diversity of the K-Cups, my wife prefers her brew from the drip machine mostly due to the cost I suspect.The JavaJig is surprisingly easy to use in place of the K-Cups and the results can be quite good. Getting the feel for firmly packing the fresh grounds into the filter is the key to getting a reasonably strong cup of coffee, but it does take some experimenting to get it right.Using a replacement filter is not as convenient as using a standard K-Cup, but it does save a lot of money.

1092,A1YJMG0QJXZLD4,B0091146V8,"I have loved Mellita products for many years when I first tried their one cup drip contraption. There is nothing like a drip or French press coffee. I still have that old Mellita.I love anything to do with making coffee and have a large collection of gadgets. The funny thing is I do not drink a lot of it but I like it hot and fast.This product was sent to me by Amazon for testing, I had my eye on a one cup maker for awhile wanted to buy the Mellita one cup.  When I opened the box I noticed two complete systems and 30 tiny little filters.  So cute..Each system has three parts, a pronged unit that you lay upside down and place the filter over and a second piece that you cover the filter with and it sits over it snuggly. You then put the amount of coffee that you like in the cup. I used a very strong Hawaiian coffee that I ground fresh just to test this system.  Snap on the lid and insert it in the unit.  A pictorial of instructions is on the box do you cannot make a mistake.Prepare as stated and enjoy your coffee.  I found, since I used strong coffee it was perfect.  Do not fill too much or I believe it would overflow.Now if I may give my personal opinion; although everything is perfect in regards to the functionality of this system I am a bit put off by having to deal with three pieces.  I am one that would probably lose them in a drawer somewhere. Also it is made in such a way you cannot make the coffee without the filters.  I would have preferred  a micro filter ""Jig"" and I find that to be sufficient for me. I use a French press normally and I like the bit of sediment left on the bottom of the cup.

149,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B001E4Q5GO,I have enjoyed the original Swiss Miss hot cocoa ever since I was a kid and have always liked it. I recently tried the new Sensible Sweets Diet version and here are my thoughts.It comes in a box that includes 8 single serve packets. Each packet makes a very small 6 ounce cup of hot cocoa. When you remove the packets from the box they will be attached in groups of two by little paper tabs. I don&#8217;t see the point in attaching them and it doesn&#8217;t seem like a good idea to me. The very first time that I opened the box I pulled them apart and one of the envelopes ripped open and cocoa power went everywhere. This made quite a mess to clean up so I am not a fan of the packaging.The diet hot cocoa mixes up well and makes a nice and smooth glass of hot cocoa. I love the fact that it only has 25 calories per serving along with about 1g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein.

Similar to the microwave method, I added 2 1/4 cups of water to the mix.  The mixture was close to the top of the pan, but came out perfectly.  I don't generally add anything to my rice except veggies so I can definitely taste the spice in this side.  I really wasn't enamored with this rice and pasta blend, but others do so I'll have to compromise on how I rate it.  This is just the type of side dish, as are all the Knorr sides, that you can add any number of things to.  I'm not much of a person for spicy hot things, but if you do you can add things such as jalapeno's or hot peppers to make a decent side dish.There really wasn't anything in the ingredients that my dietician would frown at, however it may contain egg and sulfites which may be problematic for some people.  For one thing there are no artificial colors in here.  The rice is colored by paprika and annatto.  The only thing that was slightly off was the high sodium content, but it wasn't quite as high as the Creole Garlic Butter.  If you are going low sodium, you may wish to take a pass on this one.

It is really difficult to get gluten free bars that have a nice texture to it so this bar falls into the ""to be improved"" category.  The texture is chalky and dense.  The flavor was not as bad but it had some aftertaste to it.  This bar tasted like cocoa powder mixed with some protein powder (the chalky kind), then some oil (or glycerin as it states) and some sweetener.  In this case it contains maltitol which is a sugar alcohol.  I had an upset stomach for several hours and then lots, I mean LOTS of gas....not cool....won't be buying this, sorry.",2.0
482,AEL6CQNQXONBX,B0041NYV8E,I used one packet in a large cup and added hot water. I thought this drink would be yellow but it ended up looking dark brown and I would compare it to rusty looking water. I had never tried a lemon ginger drink before and didn't entirely know what to expect. I figured it would be like a strong lemon flavored tea. Instead I got rust colored and spicy hot cup of disgusting water. I could taste the lemon but the ginger was incredibly strong and was quite honestly the nastiest thing I have ever drunk. I forced myself to consume about half of the cup to give it an honest try but ended up pouring the rest down the sink and will never try again. It also left my lips tingly as if I had just eaten a bunch of hot peppers. I know everyone has different taste but I find it difficult to believe that some people actually like this stuff.,1.0
1267,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B009M516HU,"This Side Matters Roasted Garlic and Broccoli Couscous is quite good tasting and is also easy to make following the microwave instructions on the box.

This makes adding a ""different"" starch (other than potatoes or rice) very easy.Highly Recommended!CFH",5.0
950,A1YJMG0QJXZLD4,B007JFXWRC,"I love tea, tea of all kinds.  I prefer loose tea or cake tea that you have to break off a piece and steep it in hot water, or I go in my backyard and gather some leaves from plants like wild strawberries, or Perillo.  I sometimes mix them together, so when I opened this box and found this new, to me, pyramid tea bag I was surprised.  I liked it, I boiled the water and let it steep for about 10 minutes.  I do not usually use any sweeter, if I do it would be raw honey from a friends' hives.Time to taste, I do not like this tea. First it claims to be Blackberry Vanilla tea, you would think that meant Blackberry Vanilla, here are the ingredients in order of their appearance,Hibiscus flowersRosehipsSweet blackberry leavesNatural FlavorDried Black Currant piecesDried Blacberry piecesDried Raspberry piecesSunflower LecithinI don't think so, where are the Blackberries? Some leaves that is all no blackberry like it says on the label?. I could make my own blackberry teas with my own blackberry leaves I thought this would taste better. When I see blackberry tea I expect blackberries and not Rose hips and Hibiscus flowers.  It is very tart  I guess I am spoiled with my natural tea I pick myself.  I cannot put enough honey in this to make it taste good enough.I am sorry this is not for me. It is leaving a very odd taste in my mouth one I do not want again.",2.0
1522,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00BDFNRG0,"I was very disappointed with this pre-popped popcorn because usually Orville Redenbacher is of good quality. The popcorn itself is fine, though certainly not as good as fresh-popped.The cheesy flavoring is the problem. I can't tell the white cheddar from the sharp cheddar and it is underwhelming except that it has a sweet undertone and a strange, unpleasant aftertaste that I can't quite identify by taste or figure out from the ingredient list. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if no one at ConAgra actually ever tasted this stuff.It also has peanut flour listed as the last ingredient&#8212;which doesn't seem worth the risk with every other little Isabella or Jayden claiming a deadly allergy to peanuts. If this stuff ever gets loose in an elementary school, it could be a disaster.",1.0
341,A3R9H6OKZHHRJD,B002IEVJRY,"As coffee in a can goes, this is pretty darn good stuff.  The flavor is smooth with a slight creaminess, and there's absolutely no bitterness.  It doesn't exactly taste like a hot cappuccino (or even an iced one from a coffee shop), but it's still definitely coffee.  There was more sweetener in this than I prefer, and I found it to be a touch too sweet.  Still, for coffee in a can, this is probably about as good as it gets- no weird aftertaste, and no strange flavors.",4.0

1756,A353U0L2HAMSHV,B00DBSGJ4E,"When my kids were growing up, it was common to have fruit snacks in the pantry.  Now that they have gotten older and moved out, it's still common for  me to have fruit snacks in the pantry.  I've always loved gummi treats; whether it was bears, worms or ones like these.  Of course these snacks are probably only slightly better than their candy counterpart, so I don't consider any of them to be a healthy snack.The calorie count is 70 per pack on these which is mostly from sugars.  The flavors are good, although most of the time they all taste very similar since they've been sharing a bag. The texture is soft and chewy, but not so much to stick to your teeth. Overall I like them no more or less than other brands I've purchased in the past and would probably pick them up if the price was right.",4.0

1408,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,B00AHRDVFM,I think these Crisps are pretty good.  They make a great addition to my salads.  I also like just grabbing a few when I get the munchies.Flavor- I like the Gsrlic Parmesan flavor but it's a little too weak in my opinion.  I wish it was a bit stronger to make it more flavorful.Crunchiness- These Crisps are very crunchy.  It's not that rock-hard crunchiness that kills your teeth though.  They have just the right amount of crunch in my opinion.  They're similar to many croutons out there.I like these Crisps and can't wait to try other flavors.  I would recommend them.,4.0
379,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00338DSQ4,"Pasta is a staple for me - being Italian, pasta is a must a couple times per week. Barilla is one of my favorite brands since the texture comes out perfect each time. Never mushy or mealy, but not so hard that it feels tough or chewy.Barilla spaghetti also seems to be better at not clumping together when it's cooked. Other brands (other than the super expensive premium brands) tend to require a lot of stirring when first immersed in boiling water to avoid clumping. This Barilla needed only a few stirs and remained clump-free.While any store bought pasta is a pale imitation of home-made, this is my go-to brand when I don't have the time to make my own. Highly recommend.",5.0

1350,A2YW1MG1GKU8XD,B00A4ASPVC,"We like chicken curry that a friend thought me how to make (from his time in Africa) so I had high expectations.  The curry flavor in this package is not terrible but it needs other spices to complement it better.  It wasn't really bad except that I could taste more vermicelli rather than the rice, and I was hoping to use this as a rice side.  I think the rice got a bit mushy in the amount of time that the package states for cooking.  It does have a bunch of ingredients that I find unnecessary - like hydrolyzed protein and corn syrup.  The price is not bad I might try it again for a quick side but won't call it Thai curry.",3.0

299,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B0026ZYZ7Q,"Pu'erh is one of those polarizing tastes - you either love it or hate it. It has a very earthy or mushroomy taste (those who don't like it often says it tastes like ""dirt"") due to the fact that the tea is fermented.This is an interesting twist on the traditional Pu-erh tea with the addition of ginger. To me, it has a nice Pu'erh flavor. Somewhat weak compared with loose Pu'erh tea (but that's the case with pretty much any bagged tea versus loose tea). The ginger, however, seems to be an afterthought, with very little - if any - ginger taste coming through.That was a disappointment since I'm a huge fan of ginger tea, and was looking forward to the combination of Pu'erh and ginger. The flavors work very well together: I added in some ground ginger than I usually add to black teas, and it was quite good.I'll give this 4 stars since, for a bagged tea, the Pu'erh flavor is decent. But, if you're expecting to really have the ginger taste come through, you'll need to supplement the tea with your own ginger.",4.0

675,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B004U49QU2,"I'm not exactly a cookie connoisseur, but I love trying new types that are out on the market & I absolutely love soft cookies. I'd assumed from the ""chewy gooey"" part that the cookies would be soft, which was correct. I also assumed that anything with the word ""megafudge"" in it would also be pretty awesome. I was only partially right.Where the cookie goes right is that it's a very soft cookie. I don't think a hard cookie would really be all that great for something with fudge in the middle.Where the cookie goes wrong is that it's not particularly gooey as far as fudge goes. A thin layer of icing in a cookie does not automatically equate with gooey or fudge. The texture of this is also an issue. I shared some of these with a few of my coworkers & almost all of them mentioned that it was a strange texture, even the ones who adored the taste.Taste-wise this is ok. It's not a bad flavor, but it's not particularly great either. It's very rich & I wasn't really able to distinguish between any of the flavors (white chocolate, fudge, & chocolate). I hate to say it, but I've had better ""mega"" cookies.If you're looking for something ultra-decadent then you'll only partially find it here. I just don't think it's worth the guilt trip that I got later after eating them. The resealable packaging was nice but if you want some really rich & soft cookies, try theOreo Cakesters.I liked these fine enough but I don't think I'll be buying any on my own accord.2.5/5",3.0
